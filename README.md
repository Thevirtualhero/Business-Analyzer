# Business Reputation & Insights Analyzer using LLMs üöÄ

[cite_start]This project is an **AI-powered platform** designed to solve the critical challenge faced by local businesses: extracting **actionable insights** from thousands of unstructured customer reviews (simulating Google Maps reviews)[cite: 5, 6, 7]. [cite_start]The system uses a specialized LLM workflow to transform raw text into clear, strategic business recommendations[cite: 7, 44].

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack & Skills

[cite_start]The project is built using a modern AI-driven analytics stack[cite: 76]:

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend/AI Flow** | [cite_start]**Langflow** [cite: 82][cite_start], **Hugging Face Models** [cite: 84] | [cite_start]LLM-powered summarization, Recommendation generation with prompt engineering[cite: 42, 44]. |
| **Frontend/App** | [cite_start]**Streamlit** [cite: 83] | [cite_start]Deployment using Streamlit/Gradio[cite: 52, 83]. |
| **Core Process** | [cite_start]**NLP** [cite: 77][cite_start], **Transformers** [cite: 80][cite_start], **Text Classification** [cite: 81] | [cite_start]Text preprocessing & cleaning, Sentiment analysis & thematic categorization[cite: 36, 40, 41]. |
| **Data Source** | [cite_start]**SerpAPI** (Google Maps Reviews API) [cite: 19] | [cite_start]API data extraction[cite: 1]. |

## ‚ú® Core Features & Expected Outcomes

    * [cite_start]**Trend-based Business Recommendations**[cite: 47].
    * [cite_start]**Competitor Comparison Highlights**[cite: 48, 13].
* **Batch Processing:** Supports uploading full datasets (CSV/Excel) for row-by-row analysis, saving all structured results to a downloadable history.

### Project Impact

[cite_start]The platform provides a **data-driven approach to improving service quality** [cite: 69] [cite_start]and helps businesses **adapt quickly to customer needs** [cite: 67][cite_start], leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty[cite: 68].
