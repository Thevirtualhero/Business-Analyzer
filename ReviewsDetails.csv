141,original times i have visited paris and times i have climbed to the top of the towerand i will do it over and over again what a magnificent piece of engineering still standing and still welcoming thousands of visitors the views are stunning and worth every cent you pay it is highly recommended to reserve ahead of time specially during the busy summer season otherwise you may not be able to make it to the top of the tower
143,original we absolutely loved the experience buying the tickets is probably the worst thing especially if you are doing it online but once you have them the rest is a breeze we didnt have to wait at all at the first entrance possibly because we already had the tickets and the second one was just waiting for the elevatornnup on top the views are beautiful and we were lucky to get a nice and sunny day although there is practically not much to do we had great fun taking pictures and admiring the city from up highnnthe food is a hard pass for us it was badly made coffee made from a cheap machine not even a proper espresso and the desserts mass produced not sure about the restaurant but the rest was too overpriced for what you get and i mean by an extreme amount consider going to a restaurant nearby you will be better off
144,original what a masterpiece its fantastic in every point of viewni went times in a week and i went to the first and the second floor on the first floor there is a lot of places to eat with a beautiful garden the shop and the toilets also the costs are not too high the second floor has a fantastic viewndown of the tower there is also place to eat and souvenirs the toilet is cleannneverything is perfect

146,original we visited paris during the olympic games and it was an unforgettable experiencenthe city was full of life excitement and celebrationnthe eiffel tower at night was absolutely stunning ‚Äî glowing with lights and surrounded by a magical atmospherenparis welcomed us with its charm elegance and timeless beautynit was a trip filled with joy inspiration and memories we will treasure forever

148,original id recommend booking in advance if you want to visit the top floor there are three levels in total‚Äîyou can buy tickets for the lower two levels on the day the small section with the eiffel tower itself isnt ticketed you just need to pass through securitynnits worth going into this area and strolling around‚Äîthere are some lovely little spots to sit and take in the view of the tower id also suggest returning at night to watch the lights sparklennfor the best view the approach to the tower is stunning though it can get quite busy anywhere around the trocad√©ro also offers a fantastic vantage point
150,original great view at night shame the lights switch off so early was hoping to see them well into the nightnnsuch a shame we couldnt catch a break constantly getting harassed on the grounds being asked to buy things off people every minutes

153,original go see it at night time the eiffel tower is an amazing sight to see the lights sparkle at night time when it gets dark the trick is that it happens on the hour from to about midnight bring a tripod to capture that amazing moment with loved ones arrive early to pick out your spot paris the city of love so much to do and see hope you have a wonderful time
154,original oh sure its a basic thing to do while youre in paris but its also a tonne of fun the best way to experience it is to walk not least because all of the american tourists take the lift so you can have a brief respite from the incessant cries of oh my god this is so cute which youll hear everywhere else in paris but the walk is genuinely stunning too it gives the tower such a sense of scale that you dont necessarily get in the lift plus its cheaper too so its all good things there are plenty of cool spots to take photographs and panoramic views of the city id recommend going up two hours before sunset that way you get the golden light by the time you reach the top but you can also get clear views of the city itselfnnbear in mind that there are some queues on the second level before you get the lift to the top but they go pretty quicklynni would also recommend avoiding the gift shops in the tower itself everything you can get in them is available in any tourist shop in paris for half the price its not worth it just enjoy the views and the history and save your shopping for another time
155,original we enjoyed it was amazing it has stages of view points and it has different heights we need to be visit every stages and pay different costit has inclined and vertical lifts we had seen city from here it was awesome we got opportunities for eiffel tower visited wonder of world

157,original we climbed to the second floor on foot and it was actually fun and not difficult at all it took around minutes from there we took the elevator to the very top which was super interestingnni recommend doing this in summer around sunset this way you can see the views change with the light and it wont be too hot while climbing at the top you can enjoy the city already lit up at night and on the way down you might catch the second sparkling of the towernnwe bought our tickets right on site we waited about minutes in line but it was totally fine
158,original it is worth seeing this iconic tower once in a lifetime why because it is a worldfamous symbolic site or it allows you to see a breathtaking panorama of the city even if youre a disabled person theres an elevator to the top as well as a discounted ticket for people with disabilities as for queuing and waiting for a ticket the security of this place has set a special place that is reserved for people with disabilities and allows them to avoid standing in lines
159,original we loved it despite it being busy at the top we went late in the day and made it up to the top just in time for sunset it was busy up there but we managed to squeeze our way to the front to take some pictures lots of great views but some be in a hurry to get back down p and its worth it to wait until the tower sparkles we tried to book tickets in advance but they sell out fast so we took our chances on walk up we likely lucked out coming later in the day as we only waited in the ticket line for about minutes
160,original what can one say it is the eiffel tower one of mankinds most iconic structures you only see the sizes of it when you are under its feet we spent hours in the towers altogether prepare for the many many tourists there the too view is a must i suggest to start with it and then go to the second and first floors dont forget to look up the tower from the second floor also i suggest too to take the stairs at least between the second and first floors it gives you a special view of the inner side of the tower and there are much less people on the stairs there is a glass floor skywalk on the first floor too also dont forget to see the eiffel tower at night too every hour the sparkles are turned on for a few minutes and that is an amazing view best from the bridge on front of the tower another good picture place is of course the trocadero watch out for the shady people around the tower
161,original a mustsee attraction in paris take the elevator to the second floor for a panoramic view of the entire city the wait time is minutes evening is the perfect time to reach the summit for photos
163,original a timeless symbol of paris ‚Äî absolutely worth itnthe eiffel tower is a mustsee no matter the season or weather even in the rain and surrounded by crowds the experience was magical the view the atmosphere the history ‚Äî it all comes together in one unforgettable moment an iconic landmark that truly lives up to the hypennyou can go up either by stairs or by elevator a ticket to the top by elevator costs ‚Ç¨ while going only to the second floor is cheaper interestingly i enjoyed the view from the second floor more ‚Äî theres no metal mesh there so the view feels more open and unobstructed
165,original it is certainly a tourist attraction and i would highly encourage everybody to get tickets ahead of time and perhaps a tour guide to explain the history behind itnnwhile it is a beautiful im not sure i would go back for a second time it has a great view of paris but thats pretty much it
166,original a delightful experience both at night and during the day our small group had a lovely champagne cheers at the top as we enjoyed the views of the city there are many wonderful locations to take photos not just the popular and crowded areas
167,original cool but not amazing one thing that knocked a star off my review is that you have to pay to go under the tower another thing is that the prices are kinda absurd
169,original the top must do in the centre of paris views are amazing interestingly we went to the top first and as we came down the levels the change in perspective was fascinatingnfortunately we had bought tickets in advance as the top floor was unavailable due to capacity unless you had ticketsnif tickets are showing as unavailable check every day as they do seem to release some close to the date of visit
170,original breathtaking doesnt describe this amazing piece of history this is a must stop in paris we were only in town for a couple days and made this the number one stop we visited on a saturday at local time and it was not terribly busy night time visit is a must to get the great pictures unfortunately we didnt get the opportunity to go to the summit get your tickets early to go to the top
171,original very crowded but beautiful best to find a spot farther and take photos with the tower in the background easy to get to very walkable from hotels nearby can also take bus or uber book tickets months ahead to go up the tower because they sold out quick
173,original the eiffel tower is truly the jewel of paris a magnificent masterpiece of architecture its beauty is breathtaking and the energy it radiates is unforgettable you can spend hours simply standing there admiring the incredible views i believe this is a place everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime

176,original incredible sightseeing that you must see at least once in your life it was more spectacular in real life we bought tickets to go to the top of the tower we had to wait a long time in line and it was extremely crowded but it was worth the wait i do recommend buying the tickets in advance and you dont have to worry if youre not in the elevator going up the tower at the time it says on the ticket theyre expecting delays so they wont question your ticket
178,original great experience to do in a lifetime on a sunny day or at night beware of the pretty long wait especially if you dont book in advance same day tickets can lead to hours queues when booking online you will only wait about hour to get from outside to the top

183,original we bought the tickets to floor took the elevator definitely glad we did that after seeing just how many stairs there are great views we did the slot and it was sunset while we were up there we spent just under an hour up there and made it down in time for the sparkles definitely recommend going at that time to time it out to see it sparkle an iconic stop you cant miss
185,original from the moment you step onto the eiffel tower each level offers a unique perspective of paris check how the shadow disappears at the summitnat the start youre surrounded by greenery and the garden below the city feels close and alive then on your way to the top the architectural beauty of paris unfolds at the verytop paris becomes a miniature masterpiece

191,original beautiful architectural design even going up to level gives beautiful view of paris better go go in the morning so that queues do not waste your time and its easy to photograph the view of seine river is beautiful
192,original it remains a fantastic city to visit this time we walked from east to west and north to south and back we did notice a greater degree of decline in the city but nevertheless there are many ways to enjoy this beautiful city
194,original the most iconic landmark visiting the at least the second floor is highly suggested to get a nice view over paris i visited in the late evening and it was even more beautiful the park is crowded all the time with people just relaxing and watching the sparkling light show in the dark great atmosphere
196,original absolutely wow several ways one can enjoy we did the journey up the stairs to the level going to the top closed due to capacity and wind the view was amazing overlooking most of paris with the seine river at its base and could see most other attractions this should be on everyones bucket list to visit
197,original ive been to the eiffel tower for the third time already what can i say its a mass event and a terrible one the organization works well which i appreciate but the sheer number of people can really ruin the experience mainly the endless lines everywhere first at the bottom for the elevator to the second floor then another one‚Äîan absolutely massive line‚Äîfrom the second floor all the way to the top at the top its overcrowded want to go down then you first have to go to the second floor makes sense and again theres a line and then on the second floor yet another line to get to the ground floor or you can walk down the stairs overall you spend hours waiting in line just to enjoy the view for minutes it really is beautiful up there but it would take at most one third of the summer crowd to make it at least somewhat enjoyable i dont know what its like during other times of the yearnnthe ticket website is a nightmare tickets are sold out within seconds after midnight if youre lucky enough to catch them and when you finally manage to buy them after a few days since their website kept crashing after midnight because of the huge demand they cancel your tickets for reasons i dont even know then you have to keep checking for a few more days until you finally succeed in buying them again it was quite a struggle but still better than standing in line in person to buy tickets
198,original the eiffel tower is undoubtedly one of pariss main symbols and definitely worth seeing it looks best from a distance especially when lit up in the evening up close the crowds and souvenir sellers quickly break the romantic mood still its an iconic place thats worth a visit
199,original the eiffel tower a wrought iron lattice tower standing meters tall with a square base of meters per side was engineered with remarkable precision using over prefabricated parts assembled by million rivets its design focuses on optimizing material use while ensuring structural integrity and resistance to wind forces through truss elements and builtup tubular columns capable of accommodating thermal expansions of up to cm the structural approach pioneered by gustave eiffel influenced engineering paradigms worldwidennthe eiffel tower directly relates to the statue of liberty as both were crafted using innovative iron frameworks designed by eiffels engineering firm the statue of libertys internal iron skeleton engineered by gustave eiffel supports the copper exterior demonstrating early applications of iron lattice engineering principles manifested in both iconic structures
200,original it was great to see paris again from the second floor of eiffel tower it wasnt too crowded we walked up the stairs we had a pause on the first floor to catch our breath and take some photos then climbed all the way up to the second floor it wasnt as tiring as i thought going down was much easier so dont get disappointed if you cant find a ticket for elevator ride also there is a long queue in front of the elevators walking up the stairs might be a better choice if you are fit if you want to go all the way up to the roof then you need to act fast book early and pay a bit extra i paid euros for adults youth and kid
203,original we visited twice once in the evening walking up the stairs to the floor a feat in itself minutes of continuous walking up stairs the time early in the morning via the lift to the summit amazing views but not for anyone apprehensive about heights degree view of the whole of paris both visits very different but both worth every penny walking the stairs an experience and an achievement lift to the summit views not to be missed highly recommended
204,original plenty of space to walk round admire the tower and chill in the surrounding park or by the seine if you dont want to queue and head up the tower great museum garden nearby too and great tower views from the local boat trips
205,original visited on a saturday evening and there was no que to get inthe entry gate is tricky to find its a bit further down the east exit gatesnnwent up to the summit and the view was beautiful gets very windy up there so a wind breakercoat should help

211,original iconic place i wont able to purchase online ticket as it was booked out for next monthsni visited finally on regular monday somehow it was bearly min queue for summit top floor liftn i will still recommend to purchase ticket in advancen dont listen to anyone as top floor or second it is once in a time opportunity so go with top floor ticket although its costly worth every pennyn if possible try to visit during sunset its amazing view and then spend time at garden below to enjoy those twinkle lightsn on top floor there is no word for view you also get view through glass in case chilling windn in garden small etaneries serve tasty foodn outside area you will get bug with small seller if you are good at negotiating you may get good deal but in simple words they will start selling small eiffel tower replica at euro if you check out regular street shop even they offer replica at euro so be smart

214,original we couldnt get tickets on line so just rolled up early on the off chance queued for about an hour and then made it up to the second stage the top deck has sold out so would recommend pre booking if you want to go to the top but well worth the wait the best views of paris for sure you can just go in and visit the gardens amd look up at the tower for free if you dont want to pay the steep rates to get in there are plenty of concessions in there so you can grab a drink a snack and a souvenir too
215,original the ticketing staff told us that the top level was closed after we waited on line we got the available tickets to the floor level and when we got up there we found out that the top was actually open poor communication and clarity by and between the staff otherwise the experience was awesome and beautiful the views are amazingnwe ate at madame brasserie which was fantastic the staff there was wonderful and accommodating and the food is exquisite our waitress was very nice and professional and gave us recommendations for other great restaurants and activities

217,original we absolutely had a blast visiting the effiel tower we took the elevators to the second floor and summit it was raining and windy but the views were breathtaking we really wanted to take the stairs all the way to the bottom but it was slippery due to the rainnnthey had a little souvenir shop on the second floor and at the entrance and prices were reasonable we took the guided tour so we didnt have to wait that long to get through the security check and get into the elevators overall the experience was amazing and i would definitely go back if i got a chance
218,original beautiful security around the tower but you dont need a ticket to the top to enter that area summer months it doesnt sparkle until but its a great place to watch the sun set
219,original it was early spring when we went there and it had been in my bucket list for so long beautiful architecture and history there was a line to go up we did not do that instead we wandered around and peoplewatched id love to go back again paris is wonderful and seeing this was so amazing if you can go

231,original ok its impressive and when lit upat night its quite pretty but its a large metal towernnsomenice photos from the seine but i didnt go up the towernnimpressive as its the largest structure built since the pyramidsnnsadly not a landmark that draws me to france
232,original extremely busy but a must see really superb views on and top floor a good starting point to get a birdseye view of paris to help plan which sites to visit on way down i would suggest spending time on first floor where this a sitting area serving refreshmentsnwe had a dessert and coffee in the madame brasserie with views overlooking trocadero expensive but worth for an one time experience at night saw the sparkling lights happening every hour after dark spectacular
233,original go prepared for cold winds in the month of may end especially in the evening really beautiful and giant structure taking lift tickets was a good thought there are three floors here first premium restaurants and souvenir shop second a small food outlet souvenir shop prices are a little up but quality is very good and awesome view of the city top floor is a little narrow with chilly weather and here you can actually feel the birds eagle eye view

294,original we decided to climb the stairs up to the second floor since a member of my party has a fear of heights suffice to say the second floor was still very highnnarriving in late afternoon the lines for elevators were still pretty long but there was no wait for security and no wait to climb to the stairsnnthe stairs are easy to climb and plenty of places to take a rest
295,original one of the most iconic structures in the world the color threw me its lighter in color than i expected recommend riding the lift not walking the view of the city was stunning stay for the evening lights it was magnificent took a boat tour to pass the time got back just after sunset to catch the blinking lights

299,original visiting the eiffel tower was an incredible experience even without climbing up i spent hours just admiring it from the ground arriving in the daylight and staying until the evening lights came on watching the tower gradually transform as the sun set was absolutely magical the glow of the lights against the night sky made it feel like something out of a movie i sat nearby soaking in the atmosphere enjoying the view and taking countless photos it was peaceful beautiful and truly unforgettable one of the highlights of my time in paris
300,original you cant go to paris and not see the eiffel tower i think going up to the second floor is enough but your timing is important go early to avoid waiting in line for a long time also the weather should be dry and nice and the visibility should be clear
301,original amazing to see it light up at nightncan access bottom area for free and need to pay to go up with different prices depending on which level you want to go up tonlights up for every hour after sunsetnyou can get a great view from the park where you can buy drinks
302,original well its the eiffel tower what else can you say i bought the combined ticket so up stairs to the first and second floor then lift to the top it was completely sold out online but only had to queue for about minutes on a monday afternoon so no issue stairs were very quiet but on the second floor you have to queue another half an hour or so for the lift to the top worth it though
303,original i went up by the steps it only took me five minutes to the first floor and probably will take another five minutes or so to the second floor but i waited too long on the line to get tickets for steps so the best thing would be if you go up front foot up the elevators which cost double is to buy online and not wait by foot on the line you can go down with the elevator afterwards but it takes faster my foot
304,original visiting the eiffel tower is always breath taking momentnwe booked our tickets online beforehand so at least this time we didnt have to wait in line at all and we got to the top in a flashnas usual there were plenty of people around admiring the view but we had plenty of space to explore

306,original the name should say it all its the eiffel tower the symbol of france it is more amazing in person no photo or video can do it justice it looks more amazing in person yes its very touristy and theres a lot of people around trying to sell you stuff but its a definite live in the moment type of thing just to be here is an amazing feeling

308,original it is incredibly cool dont get me wrong but be prepared to wait in long lines to get up and down even though we had the most expensive tickets seeing it from the ground or a boat may actually be enough i am not sure i would do it again and if you need the bathroom use it by entrance or you will need to hold it for a long time
309,original beautiful at night we walked by during the day but didnt go up the tower but the surrounding area was clean and well maintained at night with the light show it makes it more magical and romantic definitely a mustsee but i think you already know that
311,original views from the summit are incredible but it is very crowded views from the second level are also very good and you will have more space to move around and take pictures the structure itself is aweinspiringni highly recommend prepurchasing your tickets online or booking a guided tour
312,original although we had to wait in line for almost an hour and both the third and second floors were very crowded the view of the city made up for it book your tickets in advance check the weather report from before we got a sunny day amd stay away from the street vendors that sell souvenirs they are selling illegally they will cheat you and there are police around all in all great experience but there are far better views of the city from various niche rooftop restaurants and hotels
313,original it is truly a remarkable place unfortunately we visited on the weekend and attempted to reach the top floor‚Äîfirst stopping at the second floor then continuing upward however it was extremely crowded it was nearly impossible to move without constantly coming into contact with others access to the top floor requires a reservation otherwise you may have to wait in line for up to an hour descending was also quite challenging if possible visiting during a quieter time such as a weekday would be highly recommended on the weekend it felt overwhelmingly crowded that said the nighttime view is exceptionally beautiful
314,original incredible experiencenwalked a lot the two levels but the view was definitely worth itndefinitely recommend to anyonenthis is a must do in paris
315,original visiting the eiffel tower is truly a magical experience and an absolute must when in paris the moment you arrive you can feel the charm and energy surrounding this worldfamous landmark the views from the different levels are breathtaking‚Äîwhether youre looking over the seine the historic streets of paris or the skyline stretching out in every direction its unforgettablennthe tower itself is impressive both during the day and at night by day you can admire the detailed ironwork and the beauty of the city in natural light by night when the eiffel tower sparkles with thousands of lights it feels like stepping into a dream the elevator ride to the top is smooth and exciting and once there the panoramic view is worth every secondnnits more than just a monument‚Äîits an experience full of history romance and wonder i highly recommend visiting both in daylight and after dark to capture its full magic

319,original i really enjoyed coming here to see the eiffel tower i was in total awe of the entire experience the views were amazing and going all the way to the top felt a little scary but once we got to the top i was not scared anymore i definetly recommend going to the top if you can get tickets it is well worth it on the way down you also get to stop at the first and second floor
320,original the eiffel tower is a truly iconic spot and a great place to just chill and take in the atmosphere whether youre enjoying the view from below on the champ de mars or going up for the panoramic cityscape its a memorable experiencenntheres always a buzz of tourists and street performers and the area around is perfect for a relaxed walk quick photos or a picnic evenings are especially beautiful when the tower lights up and sparkles every hour ‚Äî definitely worth sticking around fornnit can get a bit crowded and the queues are long if youre going up but overall its a mustvisit in paris good vibes great views and a true symbol of the city

329,original august evenings large crowds but the benefit of the warm evenings makes it worth while beer was ‚Ç¨ but what would you expect value for money the eiffel tower remains a staple stop every time im in the citynnbuy tickets in advance to avoid the queues we walked straight in and began the stair climb which has always been my preference zero wait likely because most people opt for the liftnntoilets were crowded but clean as usual
330,original our eiffel tower visit was amazing we booked an online summit ticket for am which saved us from long lines my tip definitely get a summit ticket and go early in the morning we enjoyed breathtaking views during the day and in the evening watched the magical light show at champ de mars dont miss the light show truly unforgettable experience

347,original a mustsee on a trip to paris the security check is fairly quick but it is rude and annoying there are a lot of souvenir sellers in the area who are afraid of the police and the top is often closed so book your tickets a week in advance or come and queue in the morning before they open

416,original we visited at night so the city view is clearly different with some landmarks lit up and the boats on the seine easy to pick outnnwe chose the elevator option as the steps can be busy and frankly tiringnnbe prepared for some long waits even if you book your ticket in advance the queues can be extremely long during the day so early morning or evening tend to be the least busynneven so we arrived around without a ticket and queued for about hour minutes before we could purchase tickets ticket purchase at a cash desk is simple and fast with a little basic french and a contact less cardnnthen you will queue for the first lift this takes you to the second level where you can reasonably freely wander around and take pictures and video if the weather is cool take a jacket as it becomes breezynnthen there is the second elevator to the top level this queue was around minutes when we visited where two separate lines merge at ticket validation make sure you but the summit ticket if you want to go further than the second levelnnboth lifts are quite smooth and fast and you can take some interesting video of the journey note the glass panels in the roof of the second elevator which provides a different aspect when ascending and descendingnnthe interior platform at the top is due to the nature of the construction more restricted actually it can be claustrophobic if you arent great with crowds as there are long queues waiting for the descending elevator which also take up spacennfrom here there are steps to the wire encased summit if there is a wind you will definitely feel it here this section isnt accessible for the disablednnis it worth the effort i think it has to be experienced once during the day and once at night however i dont think i would rush back with the wait queues and mass of humanity all pushing for a favourable position get some good pictures and video when you visit and you dont need to experience the hassle again i think the tower looks more spectacular from a short distance particularly at nightnneach to their own of coursennbe patient and enjoy

501,original omg best experience its so big and tall you can see it from far when we got up here immediately we start taking pictures but also enjoying the view the funniest thing is that you can you up in there everyone think by elevator but there are a thousands stairs to get up there hahhahaha lets go
502,original beautiful view from and top floors the best place to see when the lights sparkle is probably from the floor you can look up to see them sparkle for minutes every hour from til you go through security first which can be a long line to wait in then you go through the ticket line then either up the stairs or in the elevator there are like stairs to get up to the floor there are places to purchase food and waterdrinks on both and floors i definitely recommend to go up once in a lifetime but id say the best view is from the arc de triomphe because you can see the beautiful eiffel tower from up high with the view of the rest of the city
504,original we went on the tuesday and arrived after lunch about then once past the security my sister needed the loo so we went to the toilets and it took about an hour by the time we eventually got out for the stinking loos the queue for tickets was huge we joined then saw on the electric banner that they stopped selling tickets to the top due to capacity issues so we decided to call it quits and do some other sightseeing at and come back the next day so we arrived about on the wednesday and the queue for tickets stairs lift took then climbed to the floor queued about mins for the toilet there then made our way up to the floor and queued again for mins for the lift to top we ended up getting to the top at about midday and then took about mins to get out so the take home message is get there as early as possible and dont drink anything before you go so you can avoid the stinking horrendous toilets there are single female toilets for the entire ground floor of hundreds of people plus on the first floor only womens toilets as out of order make sure to time your fluid intake accordingly
505,original a modern wonder of the world worth the stair climb with multiple stops to break snack and rest stunning views and the highlight of any trip to paris

512,original the grounds around the tower were lovely great view of the city the summit club machine broke and wouldnt return my euro but they seem the coins in the gift shop so dont take the risk only negative was the scammers right outside the gate harassing tourists as they left for a fake fundraiser dont fall for the scam i wish there was more security or signs around the exits warning people of the scams
513,original let me just say that the view of the eiffel tower was breathtaking from the height to the lights of the tower to the sparkling at midnight i could just say that this was amazing as a tourist im sure that this pops out to me more than any other local that is from paris but i would still say that it is an amazing view no matter where youre from great time will definitely go again
514,original this is definitely one of the experiences i will never forget theres an amazing view fromnall the levels of the tower we can see all of paris from the top the garden at the bottom is also beautiful there are caf√©s and little stores on the lower levels not the top andat the top theres the office of mr eiffel with some historical context a bar where you can get expensive wine and of course the panorama staff was very kind though i did find the airportstandard security a little too much anyways i really recommend seeing it

516,original we had a croissant and chocolate at the base of the tower as can be expected that was very overpriced but a nice part of the experience cost to go to the top was around ‚Ç¨ per adult and we got to go on the cable car up the side theres a gift shop again a bit overpriced but some cool souvenirs nonetheless and the view is absolutely amazing from the top well worth the trip
517,original tickets were sold out about a month before we went there we were lucky to get tickets to use the stairs to the second floornnit was fantastic to be on that tower seeing all the lights of paris what an experience

524,original beautiful to see especially at night the downside however are the scammers around the eiffel tower its almost impossible to walk peacefully especially as a woman alone from every direction youre being pulled at to buy souvenirs or sign petitions which really affects the experience it would be great if this was monitored better because its getting out of hand

555,original its as mesmerising in real as it appears in pictures or maybe more the place is buzzing with tourists in day and in the night tourists coming back from night cruises stop here to take in the beauty of eiffel tower covered in lights theres a show of sparkling lights every hour for minutes its worth waiting for we did not go up the stairs and were content to watch the beauty from ground there are small cafes and toilets on sight and theres a green area with pond it was my favourite to sit there peacefully and soak in the beauty

562,original its was of course very beautiful there are a lot of people all day long but we went during a tuesday and had a lot of luck around pm and later at pm with not too many people around
564,original the eiffel tower is iconic and definitely worth seeing at least once its impressive up close especially at night when it lights up but the crowds are overwhelming‚Äîlong lines to get in and huge crowds all around the area its a good experience but there are many other spots in paris that are just as beautiful if not more still its something you shouldnt skip when visiting the city
565,original truly spectacular at night while it may look quite ordinary during the day especially from a far you start appreciating it as you get closer and the sun starts setting the slow addition of lights followed by sparkling lights as the night turns darker is mesmerizing
566,original i visited the eiffel tower over the weekend and had an amazing experience the views were absolutely breathtaking and the monument itself is a stunning piece of history and art purchasing tickets in advance was a smart move‚Äîthere were hardly any lines at security as soon as i passed through i found myself in a charming garden setting i also enjoyed some delicious snacks and a great beer which made the visit even more memorable highly recommend
567,original visiting the eiffel tower was an unforgettable experience its iconic iron lattice soaring majestically against the parisian sky the surrounding champ de mars offers a picturesque setting for photos and leisurely strolls making it worthwhile to explore the base even if time constraints prevent ascending to the top i highly recommend checking the official website in advance to confirm which levels and areas are open as maintenance or events can affect access the vibrant atmosphere nearby cafes and stunning nighttime light show make the visit truly spectacular regardless of whether you reach the summit
568,original la tour eiffel est magnifiquennits one of the main reasons why millions of tourists from all over the world come to paris the eiffel tower is absolutely stunning especially at night when it sparkles every evening depending on the season it will sparkle for few minutes at the start of an hour like or till its would highly recommend going up the eiffel tower you get breathtaking views of paris if you want to get a good photo with the great tower i would recommend going to trocad√©ro you will get a great viewnncest parfaite
569,original great thing to see if youre in paris you cant miss this you can go up to different levels and see the city from above its just a great thing to do and a memory of a lifetime ensure to take photos at the olympic rings in front of the tower before you go in
570,original as expected the eiffel tower was busy when i visited as online tickets had sold out prior to my visit i had to queue in the sans billets queue i arrived early about on a saturday morning and there were about already there at about we were moved forward to a security check to allow entry to the park area below the tower you can visit this part for free if you dont want to go up the tower once inside the park there are queues for people who have prebooked and there were queues for those without tickets you can also choose to climb the tower using the stairs i queued for about minutes until the ticket booths opened at once you have your ticket ‚Ç¨ for the summit there is another security check before you go into the lifts up at the middle stage there was about a minute wait to catch the lift to the summit once at the top the views are spectacular well worth the trip
572,original best and definitely the thing to watch mandatory to be in check list go on time because if had booked from agency with tour guide you need to go before time because it may get missed by you masterpiece everybody has their own vision so from my side it is masterpiece you only need hours to explore this and you will find many unique things about it if take tour guide we had skip the line ticket so it took us mins to go to the level
574,original the whole experience takes about to hrs we booked tickets through viator for the earliest entrance of started queuing about and were in the elevator about great views and a must see monument when en paris
575,original absolutely a bucket list destination its not that the tower is just pretty from afar there is an aura about it surrounded by the history of gustave eiffel and how it almost never existed in the place when you get close to it the entire area has a glass perimeter that sadly has to be put in place due to security measures before you could just walk right up to it you have to go through some security screening now make sure youre carrying safe things only you can get in from different sides but my favorite side is the one you come from that is close to a couple of caf√©s there is a lovely pond after getting in and if you look up you see the magnificent tower as if you were in a french film from the or dont worry it doesnt matter where you come in from you can get to the pond area easily and the tower is beautiful wherever you catch it you cant go wrong i strongly advise you buy your tickets online beforehand and opt for a tour guide to make the experience even better once your tour guide huddles everyone at the center of the tower you are in awe of how perfectly symmetrical everything is astonishing to think they built it in years time and there is a pothole on my street that is years old smiling face with open mouth & closed eyes back to the tower your guide will take you to one of the massive bases of the tower each base harbors an elevator system you will have to go through another security check and a small line but it is worth it its part of the journey after all so you make the line and hop on a charming elevator remember these go up and sideways so get your camera ready get close to the window for some awesome social media footage you get off depending on what ticket you paid either the second floor or the first i had paid for the floor but got lucky and went to the top if you have the time and money go to the famous restaurant but heed my words you need reservations to get in then its a little more time making a line to get to the tip top where eiffel used to welcome geniuses like thomas edison to a private meeting room he had after going up a few stairs you will see it the main deck the top of paris which can feel like the top of the world from there you can see the whole glorious panoramic view of the city in degrees there is no bad spot to place yourself but i particularly liked seeing the louvre museum the sienna river and the champs elise√© sorry if i misspelled all at the same time i got to see it at night but if you time it correctly you can see it during the sunset when it is most magical because the sun goes down and the city of lights illuminates the night with millions of lights then to top it all off head down for the required picture alongside the tower if you donit at night youre in for a treat the tower provides a free light show every hour for minutes you will fall in love with paris every time
576,original no visit to paris is complete without a visit to the eiffle tower in august many parisians are on holiday leaving the center of paris to the crowds of tourists who visit city of light because it one of the worlds most recognized buildings the eiffle tower is a very popular venue attracting visitors from all around the world with a ticket reservation for a specific time slot you are still waiting in line to be taken by a liftelevator to the second floor observation decks we queued for about minutes as people passed through a security checkpoint before being granted access to the leg of the tower there are two levels to each observation deck and for ticket holders the person lift is the easiest way to ascend the tower because tickets do sell out we were unable to go to the top floor of the eiffle tower however we did see a long queue of visitors buying tickets to climb the stairs to the first and second observation floors we purchased our lift tickets about five weeks before traveling to paris and were surprised to learn that all tickets to the top of the tower had been sold out during our visit because only a limited number of people are able to visit the top floor of the tower and because the top floor is only accessible by liftelevator it was not surprising to learn that you must plan months in advance if you want to travel to the upper deck of the eiffle tower the view from the second level was stunning as we looked out over paris from every direction standing at meters or feet the second level observation decks are taller than the top of the london eye meters or feet providing great photo opportunities from each side of the tower our journey started on the second level of the tower and allowed us to descend via elevator to the first level the first level of the tower has a gift shop a cafe and is home to one of paris finest restaurants we had considered eating at the restaurant but decided against making a reservation as plates start at ‚Ç¨ per person for each platform on the first or second level of the tower the views are breathtaking we were fortunate to have visited on a clear summer day that provided views out to the horizon miles away the first level has a partial glass floor that allows you to gaze down at the ground from height of meters feet if you are brave enough to step out onto the glass floor youll experience both fear and excitement as you look straight down at the tiny people on the ground we purchased some souvenirs at the first level gift shop and took advantage of the toilets located on the first floor we spent approximately two hours at the different levels of the eiffle tower before heading down and exiting the venue we visited in august during the height of the tourist season but i doubt there would be any fewer visitors to the world famous landmark at other times of the year well worth the price of admission but so book a reservation or you may find yourself walking up steps to the second floor observation decks
577,original amazing tower with lots of historynyou have to stand in very long queues until you can go inup and its best to book your ticket months in advancenit is still clean up to about away i hope the tourists take care to throw their garbage in the garbage cans so that this special tower stays clean
578,original we booked the guided tour until the second floor of the tour and it was a very good choice our guide masha was really nice and prepared she gave us information history pills and suggestions for the visit we walked up the stairs for steps
579,original amazing experience got the youth ticket with id only ‚Ç¨ for elevator access incredible view and great gift shop no need to book in advance on a quiet day we had no queues
580,original the lines look long but actually move quickly it was a perfect day people were courteous just keep your hands on your purse theres warnings about pickpockets but i did not encounter anything like that on this particular day
581,original it was really busy when i visited on a saturday evening in march however i felt that the queues were being badly managed there were long queues to purchase tickets and to get through securitynni paid ‚Ç¨ for a ticket which allows you to go to the top floor which i thought was completely overpriced especially as there were long queues to get on the lifts going up and down and many of the lifts had broken down to make things worse people were pushing in and the staff seemed to do nothing about itnnon the way down i had waited ages in the queue for the one lift that was working but decided to take the stairs down it was not clear where the stairs were as they had been cordoned off i had to ask three separate staff members only to wait for one of them to allow access to the stairs for which i also had to queue for a long timennwalking down the many stairs took about minutes and was also dangerous as the metal stairs were wet and slippery plus many people were running down them forcing me to constantly move out of their waynnwhen i finally got downstairs it wasnt even clear how to exit the area i had to ask two staff members both of whom seemed clueless before i finally figured it out myselfnngiven the high price i felt that it was a complete waste of time i recommend just taking photos from outside especially as it is just too busy inside with average views
582,original good experienceni booked my tickets in advance in expedia we had a great tour guide who explained everything about this tower wear a jacket it could get so cold at the top the most of the time was raining april

598,original visited on a friday buy your tickets in advance i would advise at least a few weeks in advance just in case otherwise you will likely need to wait in line for about an hour to get your tickets then wait another half hour before actually getting inside its worth making part of your travel itinerary though you must go see the eiffel tower and highly recommend going to the top as part of your experience nonetheless just being at the base level is surreal and the second level offers a great view as well
599,original i visited the eiffel tower on the the weather was quite hot that day there were quite few people in the afternoon actually i wanted to see the lights of the eiffel tower but i had to wait until the sun set which was pm or maybe earlier it depends on the sunlight they said that the lights would be on when there was no sunlight smiling face with open mouth & cold sweat

619,original one of the most visited attractions in the world and definitely in france a must do as you get a great view of the citynif you are height challenged you may just want to do the first or second levelnif you are reasonably comfortable with heights go to the topnif you are reasonably fit i would say to do the stairs to the level as it is bragging rightnthere is a doubledecker elevator otherwise to get you there not too bad as it holds people at a time and takes about minutes i think up and down then you have the tower top elevator which whizzes you up in only a few minutesni would either do a skip the line tour set up ahead as it will save you some time but you are kind bound by the elevators in the end there are a number on viatornemma was our guide and she did a great jobnyou will have amazing views of the city and beyond in every direction
621,original love the eiffel tower stunning views from all levels recommend going to the top for the best views definitely need to get tickets on line we tried but were sold out after trying to book days before visit waited over hours to get tickets on the day got a sandwich on level very nice then had to queue again for lift to top whole visit from queueing to the top and down took about hours
622,original i had purchased tickets for our family days in advance it was cold sunny and windy day in mid may we rode the elevator to the highest floor first then you work your way down our tickets were for the floor we had amazing views and took many photos there are souvenir shops and a few snack bars the restaurants require reservations the olympic rings were still up across the street the first twinkle lights started at and lasted minutes we came back to the area that evening to see them
623,original the view from the eiffel tower was amazing make sure you come here early in the morning if you dont have a ticket expect hour of wait time but honestly its worth it if youre from europe and under years its definitely worth getting the ‚Ç¨ ticket for the top floor unforunately our view was limited due to fog but its still worth it i recommend getting some pastries in a closeby pattiserie and enjoy them on top
624,original this iron latticed monster is a must visit destination when in paris walking around it you will be amazed at the sight of it soaring majestically into the sky held in place by four giant splayed feet you can climb up to the viewing platforms by walking steps or by lift walking is more satisfying as you get more of a feel for the sleeping giant and more appreciation of the views of the city lifts tend to be overcrowded and long queues
625,original the signage for the entrance around the park was confusing we were able to walk around to find the correct entrance we were able to purchase tickets to get all the way to the top of the tower and wow what an amazing sight when in paris you must do this attraction stars due to lack of signage for the walking crowd
627,original this tower is not as tall as the others but still offering good value for the money the wait to go to the summit is long but we made it ery windy up there
628,original i wish i had booked something in advance of visiting we kept it loose and just planned on getting tickets when arriving only to learn the elevator lift option to the very top was unavailable going to the second level via lift didnt seem worth the effort in the moment so we decided not to go up at all we are okay with this and looking back i still dont have any regrets about itnntip it isnt obvious that you need to gain access through a security checkpoint but you do and you can do so with no ticket it took me awhile of walking around like a moron to figure this out once i realized this was an easy option we just walked through that option with almost zero wait once inside you can linger and enjoy the grounds food and drink options tourist trap gift shops and a bathroom although the line for women was insane men can walk right innnthe eiffel tower itself is amazing and worth coming to check out i think from the ground is perfectly fine especially if you are tired of crowds and lines which happens to me for sure
630,original we didnt go up this time as tickets were sold out love the atmosphere around the tower its vibrant colourful especially after dark when the tower is lit up
631,original of course it is a incredible and the most important attraction of france and of all the world you have to visit it without any doubt you can also go up there by stairs or by using an elevator you really have to go there
632,original i thought it was going to be too many tourists and a bad experience but everything turned out great on a monday afternoon in late june nice weather beautiful sky not too long waiting in the line fun climbing up
633,original if you are visiting allow hours for the activity we waited hrs inline to walk up to the second level a little shorter lines for the elevator but please try to buy advance tickets online we tried several days but were not successful walk up to each level amazing views of the city went to the top crowded but a must see
634,original popular and busy tourist historical landmarkmake sure you book the elevator ride to the top floor view in advanced i booked several months in advance it was the first thing i visited after my arrival in paris if you book the time slot just before sunset you will can some beautiful transitional views as well as a lightshow when the tower is lit after descending from the top on the elevator i stopped on the second level where you can find shops and food i decided to walk down from the second level to the ground floor you can also peruse the shops and eateries under the tower while you are waiting for your time slot to ascend
637,original an amazing experience the lines exist any time you arrive but the organization is ok its better to book in advance and arrive min before your time slot that way you will enter relatively fast the view is amazing from all levels but the summit visit is definitely worth the money it is spectacular
638,original well the entire eiffel tower felt very over rated to be honest not sure why eiffel gets so much attention when other tourist spots in paris are way better but nevertheless good experience we went up till the second level via lifts i advice booking tickets directly from the official eiffel tower website if the government to avoid unnecessary charges also we did not take any guided tours quite unnecessary it was our visit timing was perfect we enjoyed the sunset from the top if you have time and wanna spend more can go up till summit overall place and experience was great well kept and clean it was extremely crowded as expected though still you can click lot of photos and enjoy the overall evening recommended do visit
640,original very very nice i was there three years ago and three years ago it was rustcolored now its so nice im on the top and im very happy to be here again why four stars because there are too many people in line to get tickets
641,original i visited the eiffel tower and it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life the view from the top is breathtaking especially at sunset everything was wellorganized despite the crowds a mustvisit landmark that id gladly return to
642,original this iconic tower is just absolutely beautiful after all this lifetime finally been here looking up staring a few feet away was enough for me to be there there was a line i believe going inside the barricade going up the tower lots of security around and if you wait until sundown its more beautiful since it lights up at night
643,original a must see what an engineering people in our group climbed the stairs almost to the top they said the view was unparallel one on a live time experiencethumbs upmedium skin tonethumbs upmedium skin tone
645,original recommend going to linnet cafe first as when you walk down the street youll have the view of the towernnonce night falls every hour the tower will sparklennit gets crowded so for best nighttime view go to either bridge delna or passerelle bridge
646,original i dont have to say much about eiffel tower it is the first thing that comes to anyones mind when you tell them the word paris nnall i can say is that it truly lives up to its name i cant believe this marvel was built way back in miss the restaurants on level and level they are a bit expensive so keep them for special occasions and date nights
647,original a must go preferably in the evening tonview the sun set and glass of champagnenreach hours in advance to view the sunset and sumit entry will be the pinnacle
648,original ticketscan be purchased onsite up to closing time which is midnight may or may not be able to get to the summit but well worth the experience elevator access is key
649,original the iconic symbol of paris which is now fully enclosed for security reasons there is a very low security forces presence in the area before the security check which is a shame since theres very high presence of people it can get very crowded very quickly and you can wait a lot of time to purchase tickets and access the summit so arrive early and prepare to wait you can buy them online but its almost impossible since a lot of them are quickly bought by tourism companies to resell them in semiguided tours nonetheless the views it offers are always breathtaking and this marvel of engineering needs to be appreciated even if you need to share it with thousand others
650,original the eiffel tower a historic marvel offers stunning views of paris enter from champ de mars and take the elevator or climb to the second level for the best photos head to trocad√©ro gardens dont miss the towers magical sparkle every hour after pm
651,original visiting the eiffel tower is an unforgettable experience and a must if youre in paris the sight of it‚Äîwhether up close or from afar‚Äîis truly breathtaking and no matter how many photos youve seen being there in person is something elsennthat said its extremely crowded especially during peak seasons or around sunset the lines to go up the tower can be long and the area around it is packed with tourists street vendors and performersnnluckily the champ de mars gardens nearby offer a great spot to sit down relax and even enjoy a picnic while admiring the tower from below its a nice way to experience the atmosphere without being overwhelmed by the crowdsnnbe careful with people selling wine or champagne on the street‚Äîits often unregulated and sellers can be quite pushy also keep an eye on your belongings as pickpockets are common in this area
652,original the eiffel tower isnt as dreamy as it looks online its extremely crowded especially during peak hours and the area is full of street vendors and scammers so you need to stay alert while the landmark itself is iconic the experience can feel overwhelming if youre not prepared visit early in the morning or at night for a calmer vibe
653,original wow it is so small when we see it for the first time from distance but as we approach we realise how massive and big the structure then the night golden glow experience is marvellous
654,original its exceeded my expectations i was impressed by the structure of the tower by views and overall experience decpite colder weather make sure to be prepared for the wind at the top
656,original the eiffel tower might be the most overrated tourist spot on earth yes the view from the top is stunning paris really shines from up there but everything else is a headache the lines are painfully long the ticket prices feel excessive and youre constantly dodging aggressive street sellers and scammers right outside the entrance its chaotic overcrowded and honestly you can enjoy the tower better from afar its visible from almost anywhere in the city i left feeling like the hype didnt match the hassle worth it for the view maybe once but only if you have time and patience to spare
657,original an absolute mustsee in paris the eiffel tower is stunning and the view from the top is totally worth it however go as early as possible amas the lines can be very long and exhausting be prepared to walk a lot of stairs and expect a lot of peopleni recommend to buy the elevator ticket and avoid crowds at the stairs
658,original the eiffel tower is iconic in images but seeing it in person was truly amazing and the views from the tower were spectacular the wait time was brutal there are no benches in the queue so we stood for over an hour and moved at a snails pace which could be challenging for seniors the wait was worth the experience
659,original visiting the eiffel tower is one of those you have to do it paris experiences‚Äîand honestly it still blew me away standing underneath it you realise just how massive and detailed it really is the ironwork is beautiful up close but the real magic is when youre on it looking out over the citynni went up to the viewing platforms and the panoramic views of paris were incredible‚Äîyou can spot the seine winding through the city the arc de triomphe sacr√©c≈ìur and endless rooftops its especially gorgeous at sunset when the sky turns gold and pinknnat night the whole tower sparkles every hour on the hour and its such a romantic this is paris moment my tip book tickets online ahead of time to skip the long queues and if you can go during a weekday for fewer crowdsnnits touristy yes but worth it for that feeling of standing at the top of one of the most iconic landmarks in the world
662,original the iconic eiffel tower is a mustsee for anyone even though ive visited paris many times over the years its still a mustsee for even a seasonal traveller especially now with the improved security barriers to enter the tower area
664,original standing beneath it gave me goosebumps ‚Äî its more than just a landmarknthe elevator ride up feels like entering a dream above parisnkids were laughing ‚Äî the energy is magicalnstaff made us feel welcome even with the crowdsnill never forget the moment the lights sparkled ‚Äî pure joy
665,original the first time i laid eyes on the eiffel tower my heart skipped a beat standing there in the heart of paris under a clear afternoon sky i felt as if i had stepped into a dream soft golden sunlight filtered through the trees lining the seine and in the distance the eiffel tower rose with quiet majesty‚Äîgraceful proud yet somehow tender in its beauty it wasnt just a landmark‚Äîit was poetry in iron a symbol of love and longing etched into the parisian skylinenni stood in awe letting the moment sink in there was something magical in the air something that made time feel slower sweeter the eiffel tower didnt just tower over the city‚Äîit seemed to watch over it lovingly inviting people to fall in love to dream and to believe in something beautifulnnto capture its full charm i tried several photo angles and here are ways you can get the best shots with the from trocad√©ro square ‚Äì a stunning wideangle view with fountains and the tower in perfect from champ de mars ‚Äì a lush green park that stretches to the base ideal for picnicstyle or candid walking right under the tower looking up ‚Äì for a dramatic aweinspiring from a caf√© balcony nearby ‚Äì sip coffee while capturing the tower framed in a cozy parisian using puddle reflections after rain ‚Äì for a romantic artistic effect full of mood and storynnthe eiffel tower is more than a structure‚Äîits a feeling a memory a love letter written in steel and sky
666,original this of course is the epitome of france tourist attractions seeing it all lit up every hour is really impressive great views after going up the lift and you can walk all the way to the top in the observation deck but your tickets in advance is really beneficial and saves you a bit of money as well
667,original classic eiffel tower although going all thw way up us a little expensive but you can take a stroll underneath it but be careful of scammers and sometimes you might see big rats walking around so dont be surprised but overall not a bad experience if you are visiting paris you should come here
668,original went at night and walked up the stairs if you take your time you can try to enjoy the tower and how it built however you do gwmet tired and just want to get to the next floor people are all very good about letting you pass or if you need to stop and take a break definitely a good workout
669,original the views from the top are great but its definitely not worth waiting hours in the queue the light show at night is splendid
671,original we went at night no lines at all we couldnt go to the very top because it was late but it was still great we had to take the tram up and couldnt walk up either but the night views were worth it
672,original people says its so dirty with rats and everything but in my experience was not that dirty and i didnt encounter any rats but i didnt have a picnic there i went at night and during day obviously its a must see You cant miss it a thousands of people there so be prepare i love the whole experience love it its impressive

674,original of course if you have never seen it you have to make at least one stop to the eiffel tower i have never taken the tour that take you inside or up the elevator but i highly recommend when the weather is nice to go get yourself some delicious sandwiches from a bakery and a bit of wine and have a lovely picnic on the grounds around it

685,original unbelievably beautiful but overwhelmed with tourists lines are hours long recommend getting tickets waaaayyy before you visit ticket lines are long and expensive for what you get elevator queues are long top deck was closed because of too many visitors recommend staying on floor when going down exiting because you cant catch a floor elevator without longer wait times avoid the trinkets in the tower but be prepared for all of the street hustling of similar junk for way less ‚Ç¨
686,original the eiffel tower is iconic a must see while in parisnnthat said go where the locals go on the long mall next to the eiffel tower to catch a great view a local flavor to get away from the crush of vendors touristsnnthe tower lights up at dark in our case the sparkling lights came on at a fun treat
689,original definitely recommend staff are friendly easy access no complaints definitely pre book you skip a lot of the queues and it is a much faster experience to get up
691,original beautiful place i was expecting much more people but its comfy to be there and look at the view
692,original great experience but we werent able to get all the way up to the summit even with tickets it was shut down for being at capacity for an extended period of time we had tickets for and were hoping to see the sunset from above no chance we were refunded almost for the summit potion of our tickets thoughnour experience was still wonderfilled
695,original the eiffel tower is undeniably iconic and a mustsee in paris though it didnt completely blow me away its intricate iron lattice design is striking up close and the sheer scale of the structure is impressive especially when youre standing beneath it the views from the observation decks‚Äîparticularly the summit‚Äîare fantastic showcasing pariss sprawling beauty with landmarks like notredame and the seine in clear view that said the experience can feel a bit overhyped due to long lines crowded elevators and the hefty ticket price visiting at night when its lit up adds a nice touch of magic but the daytime crowds can make it feel more like a tourist checklist item than a profound moment its a great monument but temper your expectations if youre hoping for a lifechanging visit
696,original eiffel tower is in paris city built in year its height is around meters or feet beautiful iron constructed structure having steps there are floors lifts are provided to reach top of it floor can occupy around peoples so some times it will not allowed to visit due to capacity limit you will be lucky if there is no rush and then you are allowed visit once in lifetime
698,original after google asked me like times to review this place because i have overall views on my ratings i finally didnnit was an amazing sunny day when my friend and me visited the eiffel tower luckily it was not too crowded but in case you still want to skip the waiting for the elevator make sure to take the stairs up to the floor l it only takes like minutes and is not too draining on top it is quite windy so make sure to bring a jacket üß• once we reached the top we really liked the actors in the room of mr eiffel it was stunning how long they were able not to move me and my friend would really like to live there on day though there would be a lot of eyes from visitors watching us all in all it was a pleasant experience and i hope that google likes my eiffel tower review a lot
699,original we visited the eiffel tower during the school vacation in augustnit was crowdy but we did not have to wait too long in line we bought our tickets at the boothnbeware of the many scammers on your way in different people trying to catch your attentionnthe last floor was closed that day due to high traffic we had to settle for the second floornthere are a lot of shopping options at that level food ice creams souvenirsnthe view is breathtaking you have a view of paris nice nwe enjoyed the adventure and we would recommend it to either families or couples
701,original very nice to see ofcourse but process is painful its seriously busy to get up and down the lift make sure to book the private tour with direct fast track access to lift so can get up fasteravoid stairs at all costits way too hot worth the experience but only ones we went on a weekday weekends are literally packed with people and i wont not recommend to anyone
703,original really busy on a sunny day bit nice to drink a wine and have some food at the foot of the eiffel tower quite some surveillance from military and some wine sales people for ones that didnt bring anything or want to buy some more wine started at euro per bottle but when you say no it drops immediately to and when interest is gone even is possible
704,original when we visited paris it is a must to go to the eiffel tower it was in easy walking distance from our hotel it was a nice late fall day and decided to go to the top the ascend was in steps you pay for each one when you get to the top you get a glass of champagne paris has a lot of smog from all the traffic and therefore the view is not clear but it still is remarkable the photos i posted were from the top of the arch one from a boat on the river and one from the top of the tower
705,original watch youtube videos of how to properly climb up stairs and go do it on the tower its easier than it sounds its only up to the second level you can do it then take the lift to m height and take those stunning pictures you deserve
706,original beautiful but the waiting times even with eticket are insane we booked for pm but we had to wait for hours just to get to the top we missed the sunset sadly but the view was still beautiful
707,original everything you could have hoped for and more it is truly breathtaking we visited during the day from the river and at night a must when visiting paris the view from different placestrocedaro and rue de la university we didnt pay to go up as there are free places like the lafayette gallery to see paris
708,original the tickets are quite expensive but its worth itespecially at night and we took a hotel next to the eiffel tower there is a little air pollution but everything is fine nearby there are even coffee shops made from fresh arabica beans i recommend these places to visit good luck ü•†
712,original no presentation needed it is just magnificient we booked for the pm sloat with elevator queue probably took minutes after security the views are out of this world
714,original staging area is a few blocks away and it was an effort to find it but once there thanks google maps and assigned to our guide it was a great tour our guide brought in the best balance of history humor and stories
715,original its so beautiful at night its worth riding to the top to look out over paris but the best views are on the ground up close and from a distance
716,original it was definitely worth seeing we did not pay to go up into it it didnt seem worth it but it was cool to see regardless however tourists be aware of women scamming people saying to donate for something for deaf children
717,original had our dog with us on this trip so just a wander around the base for us this timenstill such an impressive structurena muzzle was mentioned to us on arrival but not required
718,original sadly our visit to the eiffel tower started on a negative note the security staff were extremely rude ‚Äì no greetings no eye contact and very impatient with tourists it felt unwelcoming and cold since this is the first impression visitors get it really spoiled what should have been a special momentni believe the experience of such an iconic site should begin with a sense of excitement and hospitality not rudenessni hope the management takes steps to improve the attitude and training of the staff especially those who interact directly with visitors
719,original what a beautiful place especially when the sun is out it seems to be better organised since i was last here about years ago
720,original the iconic symbol of paris the eiffel tower offers breathtaking views of the city lights a mustvisit landmark filled with history and romance
721,original beautiful park under the effile tower fantastic place for picnic very family friendlynthere is gravel around the park so might be more difficult with wheel chairsnni was unable to see any toilets in the locationnnwe went on sunday afternoon and while it was busy it wasnt too crazy and we had plenty of room to sitnnwe did not head up the tower but just to sit was fantastic
722,original the view of the eiffel tower from various points across the city is more impressive than the view from the tower the wait for crowded lifts is disproportionate to the pay off once you get to the top if you are keen to see paris as a collection of tiny dots then go to the topif not the second floor is high enough and less busy
723,original the most iconic landmark in paris and probably the planet going to the top is totally worth it we went up by lift to the very top stopped at the second floor on our way down to take some more pictures and took the stairs down amazing place to be
724,original busy romantic stunningly huge a great place to hang out waited till the sun set for the tower to light up then till for it to twinkle the seine is a short walk away didnt pay to enter but looked like you could get a lift up to the top saw a couple of engagements happening
726,original it was nice to be there in the evening it especially looks beautiful when the lights go on a memorable trip
727,original more impressive than i imagined visible from extremely far away reasonable ticket prices and an unforgettable view
728,original tower was nice grass was green the brisk cool air mixed with the smell of the flower garden as it blows in the from the east all while watching the sun set on the tower made for a romantic evening the lights started flashing at it was greatnnwatching out for the racketeers selling stuff just ignore them

811,original one of the mustvisit spots in paris thats always buzzing with tourists is an absolute delight with its vibrant atmosphere and captivating sights its no wonder it captures the hearts of so many travellers

814,original what a great history of mr eiffel love for his daughter sitting chatting with thomas edison up in the air what a creation a grand view of paris from the top
815,original superb experience a must do visit when in parisndo not get fooled by the ticket touts and prepay these are silly expensive and it does not take too long to queue and buy your own ticket and take in the whole experiencenwalking up the first few flights of stairs is good exercise people pay good money for exercise like that but then you can take the lift to the very topnits likely to be crowded when you go but take your time enjoy the views and dont rush backngoing at night early evening is also a nice experience to view all the lights across paris
816,original bought ticket ahead but whe you are getting in line to get on the elevator the lines are confusing but most staff are friendly and speaks enough englishnjust got to the floor the top tickets are sold out
817,original viewed from the river it is still a spectacular sight so close you could actually see the people on the next level a must see no matter where youre from
818,original magnificent tower heart of paris definately a must visit prepared for the crowdnby the time we came down on saturday all the food in the kiosks were over
819,original i had a river boat tour before entering the tower and had lunch on the first floor the waiting in line is not too bad just get ready to be personal when in the lift üõó they stuff as many as people they can the tower Tokyo tower itself is an amazing architecture lunch could be better but it is still a great experience a river boat tour is definitely worth it
820,original a great experience once in a time life if you go to paris you must visit one of the most iconic landmark of this world but you should expect all kind of unpleasant situations hours que to get the tickets then another que to board the lift then when you are in the middle section to be announced the upper lift is broken long and heavy day but if you wish you may touch the sky
821,original the eiffel tower is truly one of the coolest monuments ive visited‚Äîan iconic and unforgettable experience the structure is breathtaking and the views from the top are incredible however the wait time was around minutes which wasnt too bad but i highly recommend buying tickets in advance to save time and avoid longer queues its definitely worth seeing but planning ahead makes the experience much smoother
822,original terrible experiencennthe eiffel tower may look great from a distance but the actual visit was miserable the lines are unbelievably long and youre forced to stand in the blazing sun with absolutely no shade elderly visitors were clearly struggling ‚Äî i even saw people nearly passing out from the heat to make things worse there are no chairs benches or anywhere to sit while you wait no matter how long the line is it feels completely inconsiderate to visitorsnnonce you finally get through the crowds are overwhelming and its impossible to enjoy the view without being pushed around prices are skyhigh for food and drinks and even a bottle of water costs a fortune elevators are packed like sardines and security staff are impatient and unfriendlynnfor such a worldfamous landmark the management seems to care more about squeezing money out of tourists than providing a comfortable or safe experience honestly its better admired from afar than endured up close
823,original i booked my ticket online and that was the best decision no stress with the lines just straight in went up to the second floor and honestly the view took my breath away red heartÔ∏èntotally worth it and such a special moment in paris
826,original not much to add that hasnt already been said one of the most famous landmarks in the world and a must visit we were unable to buy tickets in advance the official eiffel tower website wouldnt take any of our credit cards so we had to line up on the day of to get our tickets if you are able to get tickets in advance we would recommend to bypass the line up the line up for the ticket office was mins or so and was able to get up to the second level top level sold out dont forget to take some photos from the ground level also
827,original it is so beautiful to see when i visit paris day and night the light flashing starts at am and every hour
829,original i came here when i was a kid dont remember much but the recent visit with the fam was a great one we bought our tickets with stairs climbing online and had no difficulty finding our way to the tower floor was relax floor can be busy overall a great family experiencennbe aware of the gelato place on the floor if you buy scoops for euros but decide to split into and cup it not counted as scoops in one cup price for the is euros
830,original great time at the eiffel tower with friends was amazed we could show up without any tix and buy them on the spot to get the lift all the way to the top
831,original it is a must visit place in paris youll walk a lot so plan for your visit to be in a good weather i didnt go up the tower but its lines looked miserable
832,original the line was too long decided to not go up just took pictures beyond the barrier a bit disappointing cost to go up was ‚Ç¨ if you took an elevator all the way up less if you walked some was less should have planned to arrive earlier but after dark might be cool
833,original first positive experience access is free i visited during the week in the afternoon and there was a queue for tourists without tickets purchased in advance really friendly staff they helped me when i accidentally got dirty during security small language allowed its really must see when youre in paris
834,original we were lucky it was raining just enough for a lot of people to be there so we had a great visit bring your rain jacket to paris during summer
836,original the queue to the eiffel tower is long better to do it towards the end before closing time as its quieter we bought tickets on the day queue wasnt too bad as we went at the end otherwise buy tickets in advance also dont do the tour straight after a eurostar ride have a rest then do it will be much more enjoyable but the views are nice better to go on a clear day grab some dinner and eat outside whilst waiting for the eiffel tower to light up
838,original beautiful but very crowded place i would suggest getting tickets in advance if wanting to go to the top of eiffel tower
839,original first time visiting paris and the tower and i must be one of a million people reviewing the eiffel tower but with my cents i would say it was everything i expected great views huge crowds and riding the elevator would be priceynnalthough a tad expensive it was what i expected we would get from a tourist spot recognised by everyone around the world
840,original definitely fun to go to the top floor we went on a morning no big queue since it was very early but good views
841,original amazing display of engineering love the ingenuity of the street sellers to around the police even hiding their stuff in drains
843,original a must see in paris and definitely need the ticket for the elevators to bring you to the summit surrounded by glass walls so you need to find the entrance to go through security checks for those who had not been there for a long time
844,original definitely good place to visit a place to remember neatly maintained however be careful as lot of pickpocketers view is absolutely beautiful from any of the near places to go to the top it is very costly not recommended upi is working over there in france in multiple places
845,original amazing seeing the eiffel tower has been a dream for me since i was a child i cant wait to return and spend more time there and see it at nightnnthere were a few street sellers but they werent that much of a bother theyre just trying to make money and you can grab a good bargain if you haggle
846,original built as a temporary structure for the worlds fair yet it became an eternal symbol of paris stunning views by day magical lights by night
847,original very cool experienceyes we went all the way to the top elevator absolutely stunning views a must if you visit paris
848,original nostalgic stunning cant say much morejust a beautiful place to be the hot dog at the maza food outlet just next to the tower is the best hotdog i ate through the countries of eurpoe we traveled also the hot chocolate although dont be fooled by street scammers buy suvenioirs from proper shops and not the street also dont donate to anyone as all are scams
849,original the views from the tower are amazing it was quite busy when we visited during easter holidays but that does not take away from the experience the waiting time to go to the top was quite long which was expected but definitely worth the wait be aware tickets cannot be purchased in advance so take snacks with you
850,original a absolute must see at daylight its already epic but a night thats a total different setting and you have to revisit to see it the eifel tower looks just amazing at every full hour after sun set a minutes light show is started the lightning changes and it looks like its sparkling make sure to get a view point which is higher located and has a reasonable distance to the eifel tower so you can enjoy it in full
851,original breathtaking view over the city in my opinion it isnt worth it to get tickets for the summit but if possible definitely book tickets for the second floor in advanced it can already be sold out months before your visit but if you get tickets you can skip every line and be up on the tower in just minutes as opposed to over an hour there are two entrances on each corner of the area towards champs de mars ascending with the elevator is an awesome experience but i would recommend going down by the stairs as its also an interesting impression
853,original eiffel tower is an icon of the planet so dont miss it we did the lunch package which was a good way to go up the tower and enjoy french cuisine at the same time
855,original very nice explanation by guide we visited in the day time and also in night time too night time view was amazing
856,original wow what an experience it was more than i thought it would beamazing structure we climbed to the level elevator and it was a nice little workout at the top you have a view of the entire city that doesnt compare to anywhere else
858,original on top of a world wide icon is amazing to be inside of it if you visit take the ride to the summit the view its breathtaking
859,original its impressive however very tourist and busynbe careful for pickpocketers and also dodgy street vendors just keep your eyes open and youll be fine
861,original ok buy the lift lift the stairs are painful unless you are one of those fitness people the watch said flights the floor is ok but the view and experience from the top are worth every penny and drop of sweat amazing structure amazing views amazing history even better at night
862,original insta planteriknthis place absolutely lives up to the hype i couldnt get tickets online‚Äîthey were fully booked for the next three months‚Äîbut somehow on a regular monday i lucked out with just a wait for the summit lift still i highly recommend buying your tickets in advance if you can just to avoid any surprisesnnand heres my honest take dont secondguess it‚Äîgo for the top floor ticket its more expensive but totally worth it the view from the summit is just beyond words youll get a full panoramic shot of paris and if the wind is too chilly theres still a glass viewing area to enjoy it comfortablynntime your visit around sunset if you can‚Äîthe golden hour lighting over the city is magical afterward spend some time in the gardens below where the twinkling lights add an extra layer of charm youll even find small eateries nearby serving surprisingly tasty foodnnone thing to keep in mind souvenir vendors will swarm you outside theyll start at ‚Ç¨ for a tiny eiffel tower replica but if youre good at bargaining you can get a better deal‚Äîor just skip them and hit the official souvenir shop on the second level for better qualitynntop tickets in advance if possible‚Äîbut if the summit is marked unavailable online try showing up in person they sometimes reopen access without updating the the debates about which floor is best‚Äîjust go to the top you wont regret around sunset for the best views and to buy souvenirs until youre a romantic memory head to the champagne bar at the summit two glasses for ‚Ç¨ might sound steep but sipping bubbly at the top of the eiffel tower pricelessnnwhether its your first time in paris or your tenth the eiffel tower is one of those mustdo experiences just ignore the chaos around it look up‚Äîand let it take your breath away

882,original buy your tickets directly from the official website if you want to get a good price and make sure to do it over a month in advance we waited until weeks before and all that was left were the guide companies that doubled or tripled the price of the tickets the guide was very nice but we would have preferred to go on our own there are day of ticket sales if it is not busy but that is always a risk the line did not look busy when we went but the weather was rainy and coldnnmake sure not to have any pocket knives or bottle openers etc you will have to toss them out no exceptions the first security check just looks in your bags but the second set is a full scanner the day we went in june was unexpectedly windy and the top floor was closed evidently this happens a lot in the winter we only went up to the second floor and the wind was intense beautiful views of paris and i am happy we went they dont do the towers sparkle lights until after dark on the hour and we had to leave to meet our group but we enjoyed seeing the tower light up from afar rather than on it there is also a restaurant and souvenir shop in the tower without a reservation it looked like you could still get refreshments like coffee but i would advise a reservation for a sit down mealnnlastly there are a lot of street vendors trying to sell souvenirs or photo services on the grounds around the tower i was advised that they are often dishonest about their prices until you go to pay a euro keychain is suddenly or just be prepared to say no to a lot of themnnthe next time we are in paris we will be trying to get to the top of the tower and maybe eating in the restaurant it is the icon of france for a reason
883,original extremely fun and great views but i recommend the top level ticket unless you get headaches
884,original visited the eiffel tower on a sunny spring day and had a great experience just a headsup its quite difficult to get tickets to the top online unless you book well in advance we didnt plan ahead and ended up waiting in line on the day to get tickets‚Äîbut we were able to visit all the levels that said the second level was probably the best the views were incredible and you can clearly see all the major historical landmarks from therennits a fantastic outing for families and a memorable way to experience paris reaching the top is a cool bonus but not essential‚Äîthe second level offers an equally stunning perspective highly recommend making the visit especially on a nice day
885,original visited here plus years ago and my my how it has changed with all the security queues and extortionate pricing aboundnngot to snap some pictures with the past love of my life and got dumped here nice one its supposed to the city of romance hahannenjoy the ambiance of it all yolo
888,original great experience via the lift to the top we bought tickets on the day at the tower short line up and then only about wait to get on the lift the lift was quick and safe the view from the second level is better than the top In My Opinion if you only went to level this would be enough
889,original i came i saw i climbed stairs and questioned every life decisionnnthe eiffel tower is stunning especially from the top‚Äîwhere the view is incredible and the wind tries to steal your hat a guy proposed near me while i was wheezing like a broken accordion romanticnni ate a crepe got attacked by a pigeon and realized im afraid of heights‚Äîbut hey cultural experience
891,original the eiffel tower is pariss biggest metal selfie stick and yes‚Äîits worth every ooh and ahh up close its basically a giant game of how many stairs until regret but the view at the top turns you into a poet or at least someone who thinks theyre a poet bonus watching tourists try to get the perfect photo while avoiding photobombing pigeons that clearly think they own the place there are lines to get inside choose the shortest one
893,original a must see monument when you visit parisneven nicer seen at nightni would advise you to get a ticket if you want to climb aboard
894,original paris has a different energy something magical you know what to expect but when you arrive something surprises you the eiffel tower helps to understand it a little
895,original simply a must visit to this remarkable piece of history in the heart of paris if you cant book on line its not the end of the world the lines to buy tickets are not long and move quickly i unfortunately went when it was hot so it was a little uncomfortable going up in the elevator but definitely worth it with the views
896,original best experience ever long queues if you want to buy entry tickets on a day recommend buying guided tour as then you skip all queues and go straight to security queue which is quite fast had great breakfast on the eiffel towerndo not miss eiffel tower glistening for at and
898,original bit disappointed with the whole queuing system even with tickets all the way to the summit you still have to get out at the floor and join another massive queue for the top feels poorly organised and wastes a lot of time
899,original avatar was definitely nice to visit we opted for the stairs ticket instead of the elevator where we had to climb all the way out to level the second level arguably there wasnt that much to see if you climb the stairs the view is definitely better at the very top the stairs are just a good exercise you should definitely also go really early for this one instead of after am we will be fully packed
900,original i did this trip when i was younger on the way to disneyland paris and it was so amazing even though we were there at night and the pictures of the sunset that i have not uploaded were the most stunning pictures that ive ever seen

910,original the famous eiffel tower which gives paris its signature landmark i honestly thought that it would be overhyped but i was very surprised to like it as much as i did it adds so much character to the city and truly makes it iconic
911,original its a magnificent building we reached the second floor using a lift which we booked through the agency get your guide the experience was very convenient and our tour guide was both responsible and knowledgeablennthe eiffel towers design incorporates principles similar to those used in bridge engineering its iron lattice structure provides both strength and stability allowing it to withstand wind forces effectively the use of trusses and beams in the towers design is akin to bridge construction making it a great example of how architectural and engineering concepts can overlap happy to be here in a good weather
912,original make reservations beforehand if you want to go to the top we were able to get to the second level making reservations two days prior to our visit we took the stairs and honestly they werent difficult and you save money versus the elevator you have to go through security so make sure you dont have a multi tool like a leatherman
913,original the tower is very unmistakable and we enjoyed our visit we did the official tour and i highly recommend it on the official tour you get to go places behind the scenes that are not open to the public you get a guide shout out to gealle who was awesome that gives you a ton of information on the architecture and engineering of the tower and you basically never wait in line youre given priority access to the elevators there is a coupon for the gift shop to save some money but apparently it doesnt apply to much do ymmv on actual usability if we ever return to paris im sure well go back to the tower area when the park is fully opened and the fences arent everywhere
914,original being able to be under the eiffel tower was a magical experience the lines to get onto it were ludicrous we didnt even bother the souvenir shop and food under the tower were both fantastic theres some grass by the tower where you can sit down picnic and take photos if you want to go up to the tower you need to set a full day aside to wait in the line or you should get tickets in advance
915,original what can you say i would recommend that you plan on an evening visit the light show starts after dark at the top of the hour
916,original eiffel tower with great views of paris city from top level summit experience is worth it but you will enjoy views only on a bright sunny day the best views of paris are from summit on the side where gustav eiffels wax model is located from summit you can see all major landmarks of paris arc de triomphe alexender bridge sacre coeur palais garnier grand palace and petit palace tuileries garden louvre notre dame cathedral pantheon montparnasse tower the only sad part is expensive tickets compared to the experience it level views also have an advantage as it does not have a grid like top level and viewing gallery is open dont forget to take a pic at gustav eiffel pillar on ground levelnnmost important dont buy tickets online weather can be a huge spoiler check the weather a day before and buy tickets on the spot ticket office has ques but the line moves fast if possible and you have energy to climb stairs buy tickets for stairs as ques for stairs tickets are short and tickets for stairs are also less expensive compared to elevator tickets dont go for eiffel tower guided tours they are a tourist trap

968,original effie tower is so nice and actually a must see pictures do not do it justice nonetheless i believe we got the summit pass so we can help you make your choice i would say just going to the second floor is enough it was nicer than the summit the summit is crowned unfortunately and you would like they would have less people since its more money but no also dont forget to stop on the first floor its really nice there overall jadore sparkling lights starts at and on the hour every hour till midnight where the lights are no longer golden done be like us and wait till the if you have to take a train since you mostly stop working by i believe have fun
969,original absolutely amazing i really begged my parents to go here and me and my mom got tickets to go to the floor but unfortunately because she was old i dont think so she only went to the first and i had to alone to the first it was unfortunate but i did it bc i mostly wanted to go to the highest we could afford so i did and i was windy but great i wanna personally thank my parents for getting me here in paris and going with me on this journey and to finally end it all yes it was the greatest experience of my life and i loved it stars
971,original amazing feat of engineeringconstruction considering age only made it to level as top floor sold out took the stairs hard work but treated with brilliant views of paris worth a visit to this parisian icon prebooked tickets so no queue if buying tickets on the day when we were there id estimate a wait of at least mins

973,original spectacular but book in advancenwell worth it the view the impressive iconic tower itself the surrounding avenues leading up to it and the perfect photo opportunities youll be surprised how actually big it is in real life so why not stars then well thats the whole booking nuisance to be guaranteed a spot on the lift to the uppermost tower tickets dont become available until months to the day beforehand and at that youre talking about staying up until midnight paris time so back in ireland because the best ones will be gone the next morning and even at that the tickets werent available i cant remember but i examined some options and suddenly the times were available then but still not available through the conventional routenso on the day with tickets in hand we were able to bypass the horribly long queues and join the ticketed queue also a bit lengthy but moving a lot faster the staff were all friendly and helpful no bother there then its more queueing to get onto the lifts themselves it was a very hot day so i felt for those individuals who had to walk up those steps once inside the lift which is packed quite tightly the lift takes you up to the first floor then you walk around to get the lift to the uppermost floor more queueing look its a worldwide tourist attraction so its to be expected at the top you can take in the splendour of paris from the amazing view you can also avail of the ripoff of champagne in a tiny plastic flute and caviar ‚Ç¨ i spoke to an american i told him i booked the tickets months to the day he said he booked the tickets days to the day thus he was forced to take the champagne and caviar ripoff option but besides all that its a fabulous experience and a very impressive tower with wonderful views would highly recommend to add to your bucket list

983,original either during the day or at night marvelous place to go up the tower highly recommend to buy tickets beforehand at least the day i went only of the pillars was working so it didnt make sense how much we waited to go up and then down
984,original worth the visit but recommend buying tickets well in advance to reach the summit or second floor by elevator
985,original yes as expected number of people were low due to europe school holidays visited tower twice had tower lit up with twinkling lights and only saw this ad we departed in uber chose not to go up tower itself
986,original amazing view i recommend going up during the day and watch it from below in the evening
987,original it is definitely amazing to be there and to see it right there but the tickets are so expensive and i didnt realise the tower is secluded by a fence you can walk around the park but there is not many facilities nearby other than a byo picnic rubbish bin was overflowing with empty alcohol bottles i dont know of there is any toilets nearby
988,original it was a very nice and enjoyable experience since we couldnt find a spot on the top floor we went up to the second floor the kids loved it too there were bars restaurants and caf√©s upstairs you can sit there and enjoy a coffee with a view
989,original it was great experience to explore the place as a family adults and kids tickets were quite cheaper euro for people but need to wait at least hour in the line for tickets
990,original the place in itself is extremely cool and its impressive how its built i was there with my class and we didnt buy tickets in advance but even though we didnt the waiting time wasnt that bad and we got in after like min or so the overview over paris is really nice and it wasnt extremely crowded at the top so it was nice the weather was also pretty nice so it was a day worth enjoying highly recommended to go and the prices to go on the eiffel tower are actually pretty decent

994,original the glittering lights up on the tower looked magical but other than that nothing much to see or do there just a big metal structure the photos clicked there looks dreamy though
995,original classic even if touristy still love going to see it and watch it light up at night cant decide if it is too vegas though with the glitter and glam every hour at night
997,original highly recommend to book your tickets in advance view from floor is good so need not book for top must watch the lighting that happens at pm am its spectacular
998,original iconic tower that represents paris in many ways it looks elegant from the far and definitely more impressive from near didnt go up the tower but the view from down below is sufficient enough to leave a great impression watch out for your belongings if youre nearby the area i noticed few dodgy individuals lingering unsure of their intention but also few policemen doing their rounds just practice travel common sense and enjoy the tower view smiling face with smiling eyes
999,original no wonder million visitors come here every year truly iconic and worth the climb yes i did not manage to buy the lift tickets

1005,original not cheap but do you have a choicennthe view from across the river is magnificent
1006,original not much to say here truly a marvellous installation definitely recommend the guided tour buy your tickets in advance it is not worth waiting in line there one complaint is that we got special tickets to get to the top but when we climbed to the second level to take the elevator they told us there were technical difficulties and we couldnt go up we are definitely calling to get our money back
1007,original buying a ticket beforehand is a must wait is very long otherwise going back down is a line and it gets slow around noon so planning to leave earlier is a good idea
1008,original i visited previously but in the day and it wasnt impressive at all visted again but during the night and its a completely different storynni would suggest entering the security perimeter via entrance or which is marked so you get under the towernni would suggest walking towards the aquarium to get the best pictures with the tower behind younnvery friendly area safe and funnni also bought a crepe from a local vendor which was nice and warmnnuse bir hakim metro line as its the closest
1009,original the surrounding is superb lots of tourist around even lining up to see the top of eiffel tower but we dont go on line because we will waste more time to line up since our schedule itinerary was hectic but we did enjoy around we stayed there nearby for the whole day because we want to see the tower at night which was popular but yes it is wonderful we visited december so its too cold but everything is worth it there are also lots of street foods around and restaurants though if you are from philippines you will see the price quiet pricey coz why not its paris baby ü§ç

1033,original from the top its hard to tell what youre looking at because everything looks so small in the distance the restaurant was okay but not greatoverpriced and the food was not that good wait staff was not well trained and not native to historical france
1034,original the view at night is amazing be weary of the street vendors they are very push i didnt buy the tickets in advance and we got to the summit within an hour dont fall for those getyourguide scams

1047,original the experience was heavily overpriced ¬£ for a bottle of water in the second floor store no service included nor available toilets available for the charge after a long wait to buy tickets and climbing steps felt unreasonable and exploitative shame because it left a sour impression on what could have been a enjoyable experience
1048,original highly over rated but that zeal of clicking picture with blinking shining eiffel tower is real i think going on top of tower is no use there are other cathedrals to see paris from top they offer better comfortable and free view
1049,original climbing this thing is like stairmaster paris edition my legs still hate me but the view made up for it saw a pigeon steal a croissant midair‚Äî for entertainment minus one star because my selfie stick barely fit
1050,original what if i told you that im glad i went all the way up despite my hesitations that even though it was freezing and windy up there it was magical that all we did was go up the elevator to the second story then take the elevator all the way up and take photos and videos of the whole experience before heading right back down and it was awesome absolutely worth the visit the views were incredible you wouldnt be surprised would you

1076,original i looked everywhere but couldnt find a i queued at the eiffel tower tshirt anywhere was it worth it yes amazing views would i do again hell no unless it was a lot quieterthank god for the toilet at the top the worst bit are the vendors knocking around the area their desperation is causing them to get pushy

1078,original it was ok we stood in line forever moving through endless queues we got tickets to go to the top and once we were up there it was packednni guess i can check it off the list and say ive done it person shrugginglight skin tonemale signÔ∏è

1104,original a true landmark famous in its own right beautiful in the evening to watch it sparkle best place to see this is at the trocadero
1106,original recommend that the site be visited late evening once its all lit up looks beautiful and the energy and the buzz around that time is great uber is accessible late hours in paris so commute during that hour is not a problem for those unfamiliar with metro is when the shimmering lights are on for mins so be there before that to view the spectacle daytime visits are great if you want to ride up the tower for the city view
1107,original one of your lifes enthralling experiences getting to the second floor was amazing and the summit thereafter which is at the top of eiffel tower is also breathtaking just remember when you come to the eiffel tower be patient to enjoy your time there ensure your mobile phone has full battery and remember you dont come here daily

1111,original magical by night underwhelming during the daynnvisiting the eiffel tower was a dream come true but i have to admit ‚Äî its charm really comes alive only at night once the sun sets and the lights begin to sparkle every hour the entire atmosphere transforms its romantic cinematic and simply breathtaking watching it glow from the seine or other side is spectacular ü§©nnhowever during the day the experience felt surprisingly ordinary up close the towers iron structure looks more industrial than iconicni visited eiffel tower first time in may and it was so much more beautiful as there was no glass boundary and less crowd obviously face with rolling eyesnnif youre planning a visit definitely go at night for the full effect thats when the eiffel tower truly lives up to its legendary reputation
1112,original magnificent piece of architecture the view from top floor was breathtakingnwould definitely recommend to get the tickets to the topmost floornand make sure not to miss the sparkling lights which makes it even more beautiful

1115,original it was wonderful to fulfil my dream of visiting the eiffel tower we did not use the stairs at all it seemed too stressful and tiring at night the tower couldnt be more beautiful lit up
1116,original eiffel tower is a wonder and no wonder about it anymore after i saw it it is a spectacular beauty that will arouse your senses and will uplift your mood just by the look of it may be i am a tourist thats why i am feeling like this but i was truly spell bound you need to buy tickets if you go up but you can just hang in the garden without and ticket and see the tower up close and personal they will check your bags before you enter we came in the evening when it was lit up and there was not too much of a crowd
1117,original i used to love the eiffel tower area but sadly it has changed for the worse the whole place is now fenced off dirty and unwelcoming theres even a cheaplooking souvenir tag right at the entrance which really sets the tone what used to be a beautiful open space has become a closedoff park with no charm definitely not recommending it anymore
1118,original what an amazing experience although i didnt have the stomach for the last lift up to the summit
1119,original the infamous con artist victor lustig known for his numerous scams is the one who sold the eiffel tower twice lustigs scheme involved convincing unsuspecting businessmen that the eiffel tower was to be scrapped and its metal would be auctioned off he then presented them with a falsified document and demanded a bribe to avoid the auction this happened twice with the second instance being in
1120,original visiting the eiffel tower during the day was breathtaking but the true magic happened at night when it sparkled our little girl especially loved watching the tower light up even without going to the top the experience was wonderful highly recommend seeing it both in daylight and at night
1121,original the eiffel tower is one of those landmarks that never fails to leave you in awe no matter how many times you see it the closer you get to it the more breathtaking it becomes standing beneath its towering iron structure its hard not to feel humbled by its sheer size and intricate design from the ground you can truly appreciate the immense scale of the tower with every detail more impressive as you draw near its a marvel of architecture and its presence in the paris skyline is absolutely iconicnnvisiting the eiffel tower was an experience ill never forget we timed our visit perfectly catching the magical flickering lights at the top of the hour as soon as the clock struck the tower sparkled in a stunning display illuminating the night sky and casting a golden glow over the city its one of those moments that takes your breath away‚Äîthe kind that makes you feel like youre witnessing something special and uniquennthe eiffel tower is a true symbol of the magic and romance of paris its an absolute mustsee for anyone visiting the city and the experience of the lights at the top of the hour is something ill cherish forever
1122,original absolutely breathtaking words can not do it justice everything is so esthetically pleasing to the eye smiling face with heart eyes
1123,original i mean i dont know what to say its the eifell tower just amazing breath taking wiews i was only on the second floor but it was amazingthumbs up
1124,original it is the eiffel tower we never thought we would ever get to see it in real life but we made it seeing it on pictures is ok but it does not compare to seeing the real thing throughout our touring of paris we got glimpses of it in the horizon every now and then one time even at night so we could see it lit up from a distance but when we finally got there well at the park across the seine to view the tower it was too late in the day and too busy to actually get in and up we got to see it in its full glory completely lit up and every hour a bit of fairy dust made it sparkle with stars so cool and soo impressive absolutely a mustsee when you are even somewhat close in the area
1129,original great experience we took the metro few mins walk from nearest metro go at night every hour they do the special lighting for five minutes for example no ticekts neede to enter the field see the video
1130,original beautiful unique looking tower cant leave paris france without visiting this famous monument breathtaking with nice scenery around the area
1131,original the iconic eiffel tower is something every visitor to paris should at lease consider doing the views from the top really do let you get a grasp of the scale this great city prebooking tickets avoids another queue but then you do have to try to make your booking time the gift shops arent as overpriced as they could be but i cant say the same for the food and drink options euro for a glass of champagne at the top in case you were wondering unless your knees arent up for it i recommend the walk down rather than another queue for the lift
1132,original the view was good i could use the bird eye view to describe this beautiful view and i will come again
1134,original very beautiful the architecture is outstanding for its time and is probably one of my favorite places in paris however i thought the lightshow at was a bit boring i was expecting more from the eiffelltower overall very nice
1135,original arrive before lunchnbought tickets inside to the top level by lift around pm almost no line to get inside the park mins to by tickets euro and another mins to catch the lift while waiting to go up the line for tickets doubled in length online only had walk up tickets
1136,original a must see attraction if your visiting paris the views are amazing
1140,original the tower has three levels for visitors with restaurants on the first and second levels the top levels upper platform is m ft above the ground‚Äîthe highest public observation deck in the european unionnnsecurity and checks have doubled since we last went
1141,original lovely visitnworth going underneath you can do this for free even if you dont go upnif you do decide to go up this is expensive and the queens even in the week can take well over an hour but it was still worth it in my opinion for the fantastic view of the citynnmake sure to visit after dark at some to see it sparkle on the hour
1142,original we love visiting the eiffel tower our only concern was the total lack of restroom facilities available the lines for facilities was extensive on the womens side you can tell a man designed these restrooms the eiffel tower was magnus but
1143,original the eiffel tower a landmark synonymous with paris is said to be seen from nearly every window i vividly remember one dusk away from sacr√©c≈ìur when it shone in gold against the blue light
1144,original well i think if you book with a tour something goes faster and the lady that was with us was very nice
1145,original it is a world famous landmark the tower can be visited during daytime or at night however in the evening the tower is beautifully illuminated which could be seen from far away many visitors go for the night display as evidently a large crowd is still gathering around the area late in the night
1147,original we walked up the first levels on a sunday morning at amnperfect way to start the day we actually started at notre dame cathedral at am and had an omelette and rode bikes over which was perfectnthe stairs are manageable and the elevator to the top is amazing the views of paris are spectacular on a sunny day
1148,original the single landmark that symbolizes paris definitely get advance tickets online if youre looking to get up to the upper floors for views of the city
1149,original it has always been a dream of mine to see this iconic tower it is beautiful and a very popular attraction i actually got the tickets on line through the tower website as soon as they were available which is about months out this insures that you can get a time and a date that works for you there is no need to go through a tour company unless you really want to do so the line to go to the top is way shorter if you already have your ticket you will be given a time and we did not wait very long with our ticketsnviews from the top are breathtaking if possible take the stairs during some part of your visit you can see the intricate workings of the underside of the tower and so much more this waynalso if possible try to catch a glimpse of it at night it is even more beautiful then
1151,original visiting the eiffel tower was an unforgettable experience the iconic structure is even more breathtaking in person the views from the top are absolutely stunning offering a panoramic look at the beautiful city of paris the lights at night make the tower sparkle creating a magical ambiancennthe elevator ride up was smooth and the staff were friendly and helpful there are also plenty of photo opportunities so be sure to bring your camera we enjoyed a delightful meal at the restaurant which was a bit pricey but worth it for the view and atmospherennoverall the eiffel tower is a mustsee landmark that lives up to the hype highly recommended for anyone visiting paris
1152,original amazing experience you need to get tickets in advance to go to the top but its so worth it
1153,original i mean its the eiffel tower right a globally famous structure it has fabulous views a bit of a queue for the lift even though the time was booked so patience is needed might have taken minutes after the alotted time to hit the lift but like i said its the eiffel tower doesnt cost that much more for the lift but the stairs are the best workout session in paris
1154,original definitely recommend visiting eiffel tower once in your life not overhyped looks magical specially at night
1156,original there is no other possible rating than it is always busy you have to book ahead of time or then you can just admire this land mark from the side walk which is whats we did and still enjoy yourself
1157,original it was second time i was in paris i saw eiffel tower at night it was amazing but i dont understand the meaning of this sculpture i think its a big antenna to find foreign world the only thing there was a lot of people
1158,original when i came in we had to wait hours to get a ticket to the top and it was so crowded you could barely move through the crowd granted we were there in june and now it is only early may but today we didnt even have to stand in line to buy a ticket we walked up to the second floor and then took the elevator the rest of the way up its a must do when youre in paris we decided it was better to enjoy the scenes from above right before sunset and then take pictures of the sunset from below lovely park area at the bottom that anyone can visit for free and walk around the pond there are limited food options at the bottom but snacks that you can munch on the bathroom has a long line but its free i tried to buy tickets online and was unable to so was very pleasantly surprised that it was so easy to get tickets on site
1159,original the eiffel tower a glittering icon but is it worth the hypenthe eiffel tower a symbol of paris and a marvel of engineering certainly lives up to its iconic status its intricate latticework soaring height and sparkling lights create a breathtaking sight especially at nighthowever the allure of this landmark is often overshadowed by the commercialism that surrounds itnthe area surrounding the tower is a bustling hub of tourist activity packed with souvenir shops and vendors while this offers a plethora of options for those seeking mementos it can also be overwhelming and somewhat intrusive some visitors have reported feeling harassed by persistent vendors detracting from the overall experiencenadditionally the limited dining options near the tower can be disappointing particularly for those looking for a leisurely meal with a view with such a high influx of tourists finding a decent restaurant without a long wait can be challengingnwhile the eiffel tower itself is undoubtedly impressive the surrounding commercialization and lack of convenient dining options can somewhat diminish the overall experience its worth considering whether the iconic status and the associated costs justify the potential drawbacksnultimately whether the eiffel tower is worth the hype is a matter of personal preference for some the sheer grandeur and historical significance may outweigh the drawbacks however for others the commercialization and limited amenities may leave them feeling underwhelmed
1161,original buy your tickets in advance with the elevator if you can but you can also use the stairs good luck ride the hopon hopoff bus the view from the top is amazing but the climb is a pain and be careful with pick pockets and scammers
1162,original beautiful views i took the ticket to the very top but the queue was crazy it took to get up for a timed ticket
1164,original beautiful landmark which can be seen for miles stunning views from the top of the tower especially at night i wouldnt advise going up in the lifts if you get claustrophobic as they pack you in like sardines in a can it was very busy and best to book in advanced
1165,original visited in the evening as was expecting shorter queues but unfortunately was very busy and line moving slowly the eiffel tower itself was lit up beautifully at for min definitely worth seeing
1166,original no words to explain the about the wonder from your wishlist the love was in the airrrr
1167,original bought tickets in advance and the weather closed the tower for the rest of the day if we hadnt bought tickets we could have gone up to the top any time but were leaving early the next morning so missed out noones fault but disappointed all the same
1168,original ok i thought this place has been done to to death but seeing this place was the highlight of my trip much prettier at night when theres a light show
1169,original worth staying for the hourly sparkling lights on the hour every eveningnits busy but a lovely vibe
1171,original easy to get there public transport works well lights are sparkle every firts of the hour after sunset got totally switched off after midnight npark in front of was closed with cordonsnbe aware many seller around they are pretty annoying selling flowers alcohol and soft drinks from icy buckets approaching you every that really makes your stay unenjoyable
1172,original when the weather is good its very worth going to the very top online tickets for the top lift were not available a few days before the visit but we got tickets on the spot in the morning i didnt have to queuenwhen taking the lift to the top i recommend that you try to stand in the lift at the door where you enter the lift this gives you a panoramic view and a breathtaking experience as you go up it is worth making the effort to have this position
1175,original absoluely stunning place been here many times but paris itself is a stunning city
1176,original i prefer to come at evening enjoying river boat tour first and enjoying the night light of eiffel tower was great for me
1177,original been a few times before but not when it had so much security we opted for the stairs tour not the lift so we didnt wait too long the lift que was hour wait lovely when you get up there but i would leave a good few hours free of your day to do it
1178,original we queued up for about hours at about in april wet managed to get tickets for our family of five to the second floor as the top floor was fully occupiednnthe views were awesome even from the second floor you get a real sense of the vastness of the citynnwrap up warm as it got chilli in the windnnwe saw the first time the eiffel tower sparkled at whilst we were on the tower and at from the champs de mars we preferred the view from the ground
1180,original the eiffel tower was built for exposition universelle in paris celebrating anniversary of french revolution it was picked among different designs one being a huge elephant the winning design of the tower was designed by gustave eiffel the tower was built in around years and was supposed to be dismantled years later when gustave eiffel added a radio antenna at the top of the eiffel tower he proved that the tower could be useful and therefore they decided to not dismantle it which later on turned into a national treasure now it is the most visited paid monument in the world hosting over million visitors each year
1182,original another disappointing landmark fences everywhere ruined the aesthetic although the entrance is free to the park you need to reserve tickets to guarantee a ride on the tram up the inside of the tower so many people hawking their wares there
1183,original when you want to enter from door a which is closer to south pillar that takes you to the top by stairs they have two lines for ticket holders and non ticket holders the line was almost always empty and faster because there were two security checks on the non ticket holders but the ticket holders had a greater line and only one security point all of us end up in the same spot when we enter either way but people who got tickets online prior had to wait longer to get into the premises this was a real shame considering people got tickets to skip lines and have less waiting time they should really consider changing this system or improving it
1184,original its impossible to be in paris and not see the eiffel tower as it is the symbol of the city whether its worth waiting in the long line to go up is up to you in my opinion the downside of the view from the tower is that you cant actually see the tower itself instead we went up the montparnasse tower which offers a wonderful view of the city and the eiffel tower itself
1185,original absolutely wonderful i highly recommend buying tickets in advance and taking the elevator to the second floor
1186,original visiting the eiffel tower is almost a rite of passage when traveling to paris alongside the iconic baguette its one of the most recognizable symbols of the city no matter where you stand theres no bad angle for a photo‚Äîits all about how you choose to capture the momentnnif you plan to go to the top be prepared for lines especially during peak seasons to make the most of your visit do your research in advance and book tickets that suit your schedule be cautious of scams‚Äîif a deal seems too good to be true it probably is since the eiffel tower is a major tourist hotspot pickpockets and scam artists often target distracted visitors stay aware of your surroundings and safeguard your belongings to fully enjoy the experience
1187,original an absolute must visit in paris if youre coming here you probably know what it is but lets say that this is the very first time you are stepping outside a sort of cave in this case this is a very tall tower made of metal it has four legs and one pointy extremity it was built just because apparently built just to check if they could and to serve as an antenna it was planned to be dismantled in years but french workers are extremely slow still not as bad as the spanish with sagrada fam√≠liannit was kind of ugly and it served no cosmetic purpose back then but like some people in our lives after a while france got used to its weird shape and even started to appreciate its peculiar looks they added several lights and shining objects to it and it worked its now very pretty unlike what happens with people that very rarely step out of uglinessnni would guess that paris is very happy with its tower so much so it became a big symbol of the city itself so to finish my evaluation id say it serves all the towering needs of the french population and their guests five out of five

1375,original sooo pretty at night in the daytime its very anticlimactic so try to go at nighttime and the first minutes of every hour at night it sparkles the tower has a sensor so only when its dark will it turn on so in the summer id assume even though it may be night if its not dark the lights wont come on so bare that in mind tickets to go to the floor were approximately ‚Ç¨ and to the top floor ‚Ç¨
1377,original spectacular but book in advancenwell worth it the view the impressive iconic tower itself the surrounding avenues leading up to it and the perfect photo opportunities youll be surprised how actually big it is in real life so why not stars then well thats the whole booking nuisance to be guaranteed a spot on the lift to the uppermost tower tickets dont become available until months to the day beforehand and at that youre talking about staying up until midnight paris time so back in ireland because the best ones will be gone the next morning and even at that the tickets werent available i cant remember but i examined some options and suddenly the times were available then but still not available through the conventional routenso on the day with tickets in hand we were able to bypass the horribly long queues and join the ticketed queue also a bit lengthy but moving a lot faster the staff were all friendly and helpful no bother there then its more queueing to get onto the lifts themselves it was a very hot day so i felt for those individuals who had to walk up those steps once inside the lift which is packed quite tightly the lift takes you up to the first floor then you walk around to get the lift to the uppermost floor more queueing look its a worldwide tourist attraction so its to be expected at the top you can take in the splendour of paris from the amazing view you can also avail of the ripoff of champagne in a tiny plastic flute and caviar ‚Ç¨ i spoke to an american i told him i booked the tickets months to the day he said he booked the tickets days to the day thus he was forced to take the champagne and caviar ripoff option but besides all that its a fabulous experience and a very impressive tower with wonderful views would highly recommend to add to your bucket list

1534,original no words needed for this magnificent structurenbeware of scammers if you are thinking you are good at not getting scammed let me tell you i thought so too rolling on the floor laughingni took a guided tour to the second floor and then went up to summitnit is worth visiting to the summit anyone who visits here try to view sunset from the top and finally see sparkle of tower at pmneverything is worth itni went in the october so days are getting shorter but not too short and not too cold one can plan to enter the tower around go to second floor and roam around for a bit and then go to summit and see sunset and then return to the second floor and back to the ground by the time it is dark of course this is just my suggestionnonce it is dark head towards the opposite side of the eiffel tower to have an amazing viewnto commute to eiffel the best way is to get on to an underground subway or a metro google maps is very helpful i suggest one to purchase a zone navigo pass that takes you to many places and attractionsnof course taxis are there but they might be next level expensive not sure i trusted my legs to take me around

1547,original loved the view and the staff but the cues were really long which was the o ly downside
1548,original the eiffel tower is just as breathtaking in person as youd imagine whether you see it during the day or lit up at night it never gets old the atmosphere around it is lively with street performers and vendors adding to the experience if you want a great photo without the usual crowds head to rue de luniversit√©‚Äîit frames the tower beautifully and gives you that classic parisian street shot

1559,original definitely worth a trip up the eiffel tower lots of toilets and places to eat and shop within the eiffel tower lovely gardens underneath it a tunnel you can walk over on the first level it only took about mins to get into it and then another minutes in queue to buy tickets to go up a very quick lift ride and option to walk back down
1560,original very crowded in junenbuy your tickets online in advance to save on timenwe went up the stairs which is doable but came down with the elevator
1561,original the experience is amazing but you need to watch out for pickpockets and there are so many vendors to take away from the experience
1562,original it is really nice to walk around and experience the eiffel tower by night with the glittering lights every top of the hour

1564,original going to the top is amazing book well in advance i attempted to purchase standard summit tickets for early december approx days in advance but were sold out ended up purchasing the summit champagne package to guarantee access without wait times would have been hours and not guaranteed the cost was but met our goal of going to the top with a short wait
1565,original one of the biggest names in the world i would keep the eiffel tower in the seven wonders of the world from my childhood days i saw this tower in pictures movies and all and i always dreamt of visiting this place so finally my dream came true on when we came for our paris trip from scotland this place is itself a brand and a name and an icon so i dont have much things to tell about the eiffel tower i would say that just come and watch this iconic beauty
1567,original one of the most spectacular buildings ive ever seen
1568,original a must see historical and artistic monument of paris to the whole world
1569,"original not sure what to say that hasnt already been said we started by beating the lines and saving a bit of money by buying tickets to take the stairs escalier up to the first and second level almost no wait to buy these cheaper tickets but a daunting steps to get to level and a total of steps to get to level from there you have to take an elevator to the very top about more steps if the stairs were accessible each level had loads of picture opportunities level had a little coffee stand where we rested and also looked down through the glass floor to see the people below the most far reaching views are of course from the very top if you plan to use the elevator i would recommend buying tickets in advance as the lines can get very long a few historical pieces along the way such as the old sinch for the old elevators pictures of king george lots of place markings labelled Keep It Simple, Stupid here"
1570,original the queue was very long to buy tickets and get in so i advise to but tickets before hand
1571,original visited the tower twice once during the day and once at night for the light show definitely worth the visit quite the impressive structurennbe aware that there are people selling random eiffel tower souvenirsoffers to take photos around the structure you can simply decline and we didnt find them to be too aggressive that being said have your wits about you we went at midnight for the light show and it was pretty safe
1572,original visiting the eiffel tower was a dream come true very busy with lots of people visiting as well its easy to get good photos though with good views of the eiffel tower in the background i didnt go inside i was content seing it on the outside there is a crepe and waffle stall right by there that was good and price reasonable they are located on the back end between the eiffel tower and the gardens the gardens are fenced off but the stall is right outside the gate i was able to get a good pic in the gardens before they closed the gates again i think some people opened the gates themselves and werent supposed to but not when we went back a couple of days later we couldnt get in the gardens where we were just days before
1574,original people who tell you to skip the summit dont listen to them the view is spectacular from the top
1577,original well built definitely built to lastnnwould walk past it againnndont waste time going upnnjust like any other observation deck in the world
1579,original the eiffel tower is a masterpiece its even more breathtaking in person than in photos the intricate ironwork the height and the views are simply aweinspiring i took my time walking around the base admiring the details and then decided to take the elevator to the top the panoramic views of paris are stunningnit was a bit crowded with tourists from all over the world which added to the lively atmosphere i was traveling alone but i had no trouble finding people to take pictures with me everyone was friendly and happy to help a mustvisit for any trip to the city of lights
1580,original its a beautiful tower when the lights come on at night its really interesting the park next to the tower is really nice and provides a great space to admire it
1583,original once in a lifetime experience we went at night which is so much better than the daytime as there are zero queues we braved going to the very top which is terrifying but im glad that i braved it magical
1584,original it was an incredible experience the weather was beautiful and to my surprise it wasnt as crowded as i expected i strongly recommend buying tickets in advance to avoid any hassle seeing the eiffel tower in person is truly outstanding its a mustvisit if youre in paris
1586,original spectacular tower and view from outside however things are different from inside specially regarding the queue length and duration lets get closer step by step if you decide to get inside this lovely you wait for the security check you need to have your bag controlled but not via xray machines but manually by people this first and surprisingly fast moving line compared to the next ones is separated into two ones who have tickets and ones who dont but they end up in the same place with no distinction so just join whichever line is faster nobody asks you about a after the first line you are in between the legs of the tower and literally under it if you havent bookefd a ticket in advance first of all i am sorry for you and i feel for you next there are multiple ticket offices each located near the legs you need to find the one you need to go depending on how you want to go up by elevator or by stairs one ticket office was offering reduced prices it can be seen from the information when you start waiting in a line to get a ticket dont forget that these tickets are only valid for immediate entrance and cannot be used for later in the day or the next day if you have plans in the next hours just forget about them because that ticket line should not be underestimated we waited for hours and from time to time only out of kiosk was working and decided not to go up bc it would be extremely rushed with our schedulennmoral of the story get your tickets in advance touristic places in paris are not the most efficient when it comes to queue management or waiting time optimization
1587,original one of the worlds miracles and the place to visit foods and drinks are severily overpriced but you still cannot miss the experience of visiting someone this old but still standing strong
1588,original this extraordinary landmark is the most iconic structure in paris built for a world exhibition and meant to last only a few decades here it is still dominating paris skyline it is a miracle of engineering you can ascend to the top in a lift which is not recommended for those with vertigo you can walk up the stairs to at least the second level the only downsides can be the wait to go up during busy times and the aggressive trinket sellers a wonderful place to go up and see all of paris

1626,original i had the most lovely experience at the eiffel tower and i cant recommend it enough on both of my visits i prebooked tickets with lift access instead of buying the stairs ticket which can be very tedious which was a fantastic decision this allowed us to skip the long queues that can often take hours to get through the views from the top are absolutely stunning especially at sunsetnnit can get quite cold up there so if youre visiting during the winter or spring definitely bring some gloves my hands were freezing but the breathtaking views made it all worth it

1643,original the eiffel tower a symbol of paris and a marvel of engineering never fails to captivate the heart my recent visit shrouded in a delicate veil of fog only heightened its ethereal beauty as i approached the iconic structure its silhouette emerged from the mist a vision of grace and grandeur the fog softened its edges creating an almost dreamlike atmospherenthe towers intricate latticework normally a masterpiece of detail was now cloaked in a mysterious haze each curve and angle each rivet and beam was softened by the fog transforming the structure into a phantomlike apparition the mist added a layer of depth and intrigue inviting the eye to wander across its surface searching for hidden detailsndespite the foggy conditions i couldnt resist the urge to capture the towers beauty through my lens i took countless photographs each one offering a unique perspective on this iconic landmark the fog rather than hindering my efforts added a touch of enchantment to every shot the tower seemed to dance in and out of view its form constantly shifting and changingnas i stood beneath the tower dwarfed by its immense scale i felt a sense of awe and wonder the fog amplified the towers presence making it seem even more towering and imposing it was as if the tower had reached out and enveloped me in its embrace inviting me to lose myself in its beautynwhile the fog may have obscured some of the towers details it also revealed a hidden side of its beauty the ethereal quality of the mist transformed the tower into a work of art a masterpiece of light and shadow it was a sight that i will never forget a reminder of the magic that can be found in the most unexpected places
1644,original eiffel tower ‚Äì safe but soullessnnvisiting the eiffel tower today is a far cry from what it once was the entire base is now enclosed in glass a necessary security measure perhaps but one that distances visitors from the spontaneous thrill of discovery everything is impeccably organized ‚Äî lines tickets security ‚Äî but maybe thats part of the problem the human chaos the energy the feeling of simply walking under the iron lady or meandering toward it from the champs√©lys√©es thats gone what remains is a monument encased in order impressive still but stripped of its magic
1645,original must see when in paris of course it was the high point of our trip to paris it was very busy and the lines were long but if you reserve a time slot you can enter the tower with a min wait or so because of the lines for security

1669,original we were unable to book tickets online so arrived just before on a sunday and there was no queue whatsoever to get in and we managed to buy tickets straight away stairs to floor elevator to the summitnthere were toilets a cafe a gift shop on the first floor also there was a rope bridge you can walk across the gap in the middle free but must prebook a timeslot onlinenthere was a little wait for the lifts up to the summit but it moved fairly quickly the summit was very crowded but there were two levels one open and one enclosed it had some information and a recreation of gustav eiffels officentop tip we discovered that you can get the elevator down from the floor even if you bought the stairs ticket since they dont check your ticketsnthe eiffel tower is a must see in paris however it is very expensive to go to the summit and the view from the floor is just as good
1670,original white medium starwhite medium starwhite medium starwhite medium starwhite medium starnnwe visited the eiffel tower on a sunday and were pleasantly surprised by the lack of queues it made the experience so much more enjoyable we took the elevator to the summit and the view was breathtaking even with a bit of cloud cover the iconic landmarks of paris peeking through the clouds added a unique charm to our visit overall a fantastic experience that i would recommend to anyone visiting the city
1671,original i visited as a wheelchair user the staff were friendly and helpful throughout my visit and i had no problems accessing the lift i went up to the second floor not the top and stopped at the first floor on our descent and these were great offering fabulous views over paris we went at night and would thoroughly recommend it we purchased our tickets online in advance of our visit
1672,original if you are visiting paris this is a must the view is simply amazing i recommend buying the ticket to the top its worth it there is also a lot of additional content around and inside the tower like cafes restaurants and souvenir shops so you can get everything you need on the spot i went there in the morning opening hours so queue wait wasnt bad another good option is to buy the ticket online if you want to get inside fasternto sum it all up an amazing and unforgettable experience
1673,original tall enough to have neck ache nfor best view go to other side it call fountains something maybe you enjoying
1675,original you go to paris you go here the queues and security are the biggest issue in our example we arrived minutes early they had queues for people that turned up and paid and only queue with security guard for the entire line of people that prebooked so we nearly missed our slot you also have to queue times more once in the venue to get to the top so be warned if standing is not your thing however the positives are the stunning views and something that will stay in your memory and his a highlight of paris
1676,original the eiffel tower is truly iconic but the real magic happens at night when it sparkles every hour the view from the top is breathtaking though the lines can be long booking tickets in advance is highly recommended even just sitting nearby with a coffee and watching it is a perfect parisian moment

1678,original so worth it we went to the very top to be fair you get a pretty good view from level but standing at the very top is something else overall very impressive theres even a champagne bar at the very top level the other two levels have shops restaurants toilets level and even a vr team game experience
1680,original its the eiffel tower one of the most iconic buildings in the world and i have to say it does look impressive check it out during the night if you can because it will illuminate i gets extremely busy too if you go in summer so be aware of large crowds
1682,original if you not scared from the highyou need to go there
1683,original nice iconic monument but such a shame that all closeup access is now requiring tickets and long lines
1684,original it was great used viator to have a reservation timeslot met at we were through security and at the top of the tower within minutes its nice how crowd control is now been managed as in the past under the tower was a little bit chaotic
1685,original it paris i will say the site is relatively clean and well kept one more thing to check off my bucket list
1686,original the eiffel tower is always a great place to visit when youre in paris amazing panoramic views across the citynthe goliath size of it is nothing a picture can prepare you for the light show at night is also pretty
1687,original ig oursceneosnnits hard to describe the eiffel tower one of the most beautiful landmarks in the world‚Äîmajestic the iron lady at the heart of paris these photos capture it from every angle and you can take similar ones within a km radius around the tower its definitely worth visiting to enjoy the moment and the atmosphere
1688,original probably the most famous structure in the world ‚Äì and for good reason even though it was foggy it was still an incredible sight to see
1691,original i really wanted to see the eiffel tower in person it is a stunning piece of architecture i wasnt brave enough to go up in the elevator but awestruck all the same as i walked up i wasnt ready for the immense structure of beautifully constructed metal i did not go inside so i do not know what the wait time or cost is so glad i experienced this wonder
1692,original mechanical marvel good to see at night book your tickets in advance
1693,original breathtaking pictures and videos dont do this any justice or favours the tower is much bigger in person and the whole vibe atmosphere and everything as a whole are great
1694,original as you expect stunning at night there are less people id recommend to go at day and night if you want to see the tower sparkle at the beginning of every hour from pm the tower sparkles for the first minutes truly stunning check out the restaurant ‚Äûmadame brasserie while youre there its amazing
1695,original nice ambiance with good weather nice to walk aroundnni didnt had the ticket well in advance however i choose to be there in the morning when it open and it was easy peasy to get the ticket if you are not an early bird person booking a ticket well in advance is recommended when i was leaving the line to just get inside the park itself was super long
1696,original magical experience truly do not miss the lights and assent to the top
1697,original very long queues to get to the elevator but worth it the view from the floor is not much different from the view from the top floor so you can skip it and spend your time doing something else
1698,original of course you have to visit the eiffel tower when in paris the weather was overcast but it was still an awesome experience to go up in the tower
1699,original i recommend visiting the tower in the evening it is much more spectacular
1700,original i really wanted to see the eiffel tower in person it is a stunning piece of architecture i wasnt brave enough to go up in the elevator but awestruck all the same as i walked up i wasnt ready for the immense structure of beautifully constructed metal i did not go inside so i do not know what the wait time or cost is so glad i experienced this wonder
1702,original this is accurate as of this writing paralympics just finished one day ago and so there are some fencing around where there is no access to the park surrounding the tower as it rained earlier some roads are muddynwould be best to get a tour guide and a skip the line but thats for the first entry from there onwards you are expected to join a queue for the lift up floor and then a final lift up to the very topnif you choose the buy tickets at the last minute you may be disappointed as they might close off sales to the top level when the quota is at its maxnfor a thorough experience expect to spend a lot if you want to get superb view at different levelsnstops at shops are a must but i would skip dinning and aim to do it elsewhere with a great view of the towernit gets very windy and cold if you move higher up and so get a windbreakernwheel chair friendly place but i have witnessed the incredible challenges for moving around given the very packed crowd situationnthe beautiful tower lights up every hour from to midnight so do make it a point to go somewhere near seine river to enjoy the minute light shownoverall i would say the tower offers a breathtaking view of the paris town and a little outside of paris
1704,original beautiful would liked to have gone to the top but i couldnt get tickets definitely book in advance the second floor gives you wonderful views of the city
1705,original first of all i have booked my ticket for pm but i was min late even though staff was so kind they let me in and said dont worry take your time all of the staff were super kind the view of the eiffel towers is something crazy ü§™ well i had to say it but if you can run then you should use stairs otherwise i suggest you to go for lifts its a lot stairs dont joke you will feel like you just in marathon rolling on the floor laughing the view from both floor is super amazing i would say go for to in winter time you will get to see both world great smiling face with smiling eyes
1707,original i loved the upgrades thats been made especially the lakes the public bathroom could use an upgrade too
1709,original we took our daughters for their first visit during the olympics and werent sure if wed be able to even access the eiffel tower we ended up having no wait and went straight to the top we were even able to watch some of the volleyball events from the tower and watch the sunset with champagne and caviar our favorite spot is the restaurant or hanging out in the couches outside on the second level roof top bar area always a unique and fun experience every time we go to paris
1711,original definitely buy tickets in advance especially if you want to go all the way up to the summitnni had been checking daily for when tickets were released they were not available on sunday night and then by on the following monday morning they had all sold out with only one slot leftnnit is cool to see such a huge and famous structure going up in the lifts was extremely cramped to the extent that i had to shout stop no more as the lift conductor was encouraging more and more people on creating a ridiculous uncomfortable and unsafe crushnnit was winter when we visited and was freezing cold and super windy up at the top so dress prepared for thisnnreccomend doing this once in a lifetime
1712,original one of the best moment in my life an astonishing view especially from the top floor i highly suggest you to buy the top ticket you will never regret itni think the best time to go is in the night you can see a beautiful meters of enjoyment have fun
1713,original long wait in line over an hour paid for guided trip on viatot worthless to do so no advantage except for viator misters spraying over the line showered you every minutes trying to cool everyone off but just ended up drenching us staff up top a little rude i walked up some stairs the girl informed she was closing the stairs so i had to go back down and come back up different stairs why she wouldnt say just got enjoyment making me go down a flight of stairs and back up another for some pointless reason one elevator was broken so which made everything run behind but im not a huge fan of the tall place to look at the city sites oclock tickets got on elevator at
1714,original really coool recommend to buy tickets online also every hour there is a light show
1716,original what a beautiful view to look at and to look down from we ate dinner here the food was ok the service was excellent as were the viewsnthe elevators the structure was amazing to look at but it was very unorganized trying to get in and once in not sure where to go but who cares youre in paris with the one you love sharing the experience of the eiffel tower also every hour on the hour the lights on the eiffel tower start blinking at night it is beautiful to seenyou have to visit once in your life
1717,original we wanted the tower light up while we stood on a street over by the olympic flame statue
1719,original what a structure went there after caught it light up at and the energy went to the very top it was both magical and amazing
1720,original tr√®s beau belle exp√©riencesmirking facenheel mooie tower die echt is better smiling face with open mouth & cold sweatnvery beautiful not first time im saw itgrinning face
1721,original i genuinely have no wordsnthis is something you need to see at least once in your lifeni had been robbed of the opportunity a couple of years ago but it was worth the waitnabsolutely breathtaking from every angle Tokyo towerüß°
1722,original the eiffel tower is undoubtedly an iconic landmark and a mustsee when visiting paris however be prepared for the crowds as it can get very busy especially during peak tourist seasons visitors should remain vigilant as pickpockets are known to operate in the area and charity workers may approach you with various scams‚Äîits best not to engage or give them any money as i learned the hard way losing eurosnndespite these challenges the beauty of the eiffel tower is undeniable especially at night when it puts on a stunning light show that truly enhances the experience the surrounding area is charming and vibrant making it a great place to explorenni have a tour booked for later and i look forward to sharing more insights after that just a headsup visiting the summit incurs an additional cost which can make the experience quite pricey overall nevertheless seeing the eiffel tower in person is a memorable experience that captures the essence of paris
1723,original absolutely magical ‚Äî a mustsee at least once in your lifeni finally got to check off a bucket list dream and visit the eiffel tower ‚Äî and wow it was even more breathtaking in person than in all the pictures and movies the view from the top was unreal ‚Äî you can see all of paris stretching out in every direction like a painting i took so many photos but honestly none of them do it justice the sparkling seine little rooftops the champs√©lys√©es in the distance it felt like i was in a dreamnnwe got there around pm and stayed through sunset and i highly recommend timing it that way watching the sun dip behind the city from the top deck is something ill never forget ‚Äî and then when the tower lights up and sparkles at night every hour on the hour for minutes pure magic i probably stood there with my mouth open like a kidnnthe line was long but moved faster than i expected security was tight but organized we bought our tickets online which saved a lot of time ‚Äî highly recommend doing that also wear comfy shoes the elevators were smooth but we walked the first level to really take it all in theres a caf√© on the second floor where we grabbed hot chocolate and croissants ‚Äî overpriced but delicious with that viewnnbonus tip if you want that classic photo with the tower in the background go to the trocad√©ro gardens across the river best angle especially early in the morning before it gets too crowdednnif youre in paris do not skip this its touristy yes ‚Äî but for a reason the eiffel tower is iconic for a reason and it truly lives up to the hype
1724,original it was majestic little crowded as expected but the view from the park was spectacular
1725,original an icon bit pricey to go to the floors up by stairs is acceptable price
1726,original one of the seven wonders of the world doesnt need any introduction in true sense the name itself is enough as the tower itself exudes beauty and elegance moreover loads of accolades to the local authority for maintaining such huge crowd in a most professional way the adjoining areas including the gardens are really very good
1727,original with heading towards reviews on google maps alone what else is there to say about this structure that is not repeated such an attraction in cast iron it just has to be magnetic is there anyone who has been to paris and has not a picture or bought a postcard of this tower that was only built as a temporary structure for an exhibition
1728,original much has been written about this imposing and majestic structure located by the seine riverside a symbol of the industrial and technological prowess of france and also a symbol of love this place draws tourists from all countries in all seasonsneach time of the day each season and important world events bring out the tower in a unique way access to the top of the tower is available by buying tickets online or at location the views of paris from the top is a sight to beholdnthe tower turns into a dazzling display of lights at pm each night and things if people assemble at vantage points to gather a view of the ethereal displaynnnot to be missed if you are in france
1729,original ive seen it probably hundreds of times throughout my life in film and print but seeing it in person is amazing so big and beautiful take the trip to the top when are you going to be in paris againnand go see it again light up at night
1731,original stunning views from the top highly recommended make sure to book tickets in advance
1732,original absolutely amazing to see this iconic landmark we only walked around it but thoroughly enjoyed the view
1736,original good experience loved every bit of the visit it was a nice winter morning with the sun out so a good day to be in paris made my way through the streets of paris and the subway and reached the monument around evening it was not that much crowded for being one of the seven wonders of the world one can go to the upper levels of the tower after paying some fee it varies with the level you want to go higher the floor level more the money you have to pay capitalism ncath√©drale notredame de paris was pretty much more crowded for not being one of the wonders plus it was closed for renovation
1737,original we came by to the eiffel tower a few times before but this time became during the olympics and it was amazing and the recent years has been blocked off with a security entrance if you want to go inside but it is not too difficult although the lineup can be quite longthere are also tickets to either walk up the eiffel tower or to take the elevator so i would recommend buying tickets in advance so you dont have to wait in line its to visit in paris and worthwhile
1739,original been to eiffel tower many times before it was all closed off it was always a nice site to see on a sunny day especially from trocadero the view from across the river
1740,original i went on halloween at sunset and it was very busy but i had a great time none the less had my champagne on the top and even though it was foggy it was so interesting to learn about plus you could still see the sights from the floor even though its touristy it shouldnt be missed
1741,original go at twilight its spectacular when the lights are onntheres a bridge right before the eiffel tower second last stop on bus route get off there incredible vibe with bands zumba instructors and crowd singers then you just walk to the tower from there
1742,original nice experience price ok for the quick views
1743,original just incredible book early to miss the queues got straight though security and walked up the steps
1744,original there is a lift to both open top or you can walk beautiful smiling face with heart eyes
1746,original this was a amazing experience the structure itself is impressive in size and the design of the ironwork the eiffel tower must be on the list of places to visit in parisnthe views are degrees and stunning the elevators hold people per car but it is not overcrowded and the cars have large windows the cafe on the second level makes a pretty good hot chocolate the ham and cheese on a baguette was also tasty
1747,original visiting the eiffel tower was not as impressive as i had anticipated the experience from start to finish was underwhelming to begin with the wait time was excessive‚Äînearly hours just to book a ticket and another hour to ascend via the elevator once at the top i found the view to be average and lacking anything particularly iconic or memorablennwhat stood out most was the absence of a proper restaurant or unique attraction at the summit comparing it to the cairo tower which has a rotating restaurant offering a dynamic and enjoyable dining experience the eiffel tower fell short in delivering a truly captivating visit overall it didnt live up to the hype or expectations i had for such a globally renowned landmark
1748,original i visited the eiffel tower in may with my daughter and it totally lived up to the hype a few tips if youre planning a tripnnbest time to go early morning or late evening is ideal ‚Äì fewer crowds and better views sunset visits are a win toonntickets grab tickets online if you can it saves so much time and hey if youre up for a challenge take the stairs to the second floor its a workout but worth it for the viewsnnfood theres a restaurant on the first floor but if thats not your thing bring a picnic and enjoy it on the champ de mars with the tower in the backgroundnnnight visits dont miss the evening light show every hour on the hour after sunset the tower sparkles for five minutes ‚Äì its magicalnncool stuff check out the glass floor on the first floor for a wild view down and look out for gustave eiffels hidden apartment up top yep he had a secret spot up there
1749,original beautiful place id advise to come during nighttime for the ultimate experiencenni didnt go on top of it its free to enter to see it admire the tower youre in paris
1750,original a stunning structure we opted to not go up into the eiffel tower as our time was limited it didnt matter as we enjoyed this beautiful piece from many different views absolutely loved it
1752,original lovely experience walking up to the second floor and then riding to the top we ran to the tower from our flat what a lovely time to see this landmark the park surrounding the tower is worth exploring the trees are magnificent
1753,original beautiful iconic and fun to see at night or from the river dont get too close as the place has lots of pick pockets best views are from just a tad further away remember every hour on the hour after dusk she will sparkle for minutes
1754,original always very busy but definitely well worth it the prices are good and the view is amazing
1755,original majestic is enough to describe its beauty an engineering marvel of mr eiffel it cost me euro to go to the all the way to top which basically means taking escalator to the second floor the location is well connected to the station just a block of walking want to avoid traffic here are suggestions the eiffel tower is open until midnight so go there around pm or pm purchase tickets in advance while coming down take stairs it takes min but you can have remarkable experience you can also stop in the first floor
1756,original kinda cloudy but the views spectacular finding your landmarks really helps but youre on your own went to the top good shots floor bc of cloud cover was better viewing that daynlines werent terrible multiple security checks so be patient
1757,original visiting the eiffel tower was an unforgettable experience the views were absolutely stunning its a mustdo activity if youre in paris it really lives up to the hype
1758,original magical place even if you dont care you will feel something special there when i went was not too crowded but was very cold so i didnt spent too much time inside it the prices are not a steal and the views from the floor are enough to have a glimpse on the architecture and the attractions of the city worth the visit
1759,original there are so many great reviews but i am going to be honest during the day no wow factor a bit disappointing i looked into the history and building of it which was very interesting and the photos of the workers building it were amazing on a sheer engineering perspective for the time thumbs up however i stick by the underwhelming day time opinionnnduring the night time it takes on a new life with the lights on making it times better i would give it a star if i could but not a startnnthe atmosphere is completely different at night as everyone is relaxed sitting down drinking on the grass and eating and laughing while they wait for the lights to come on during the daytime i saw people in the middle of the road making ticktock whilst trying not to get run over i saw a girl jump up times in the air to get the perfect picture and lay on the floor to rest afterwards and others dressed like the stereotypes of french doing the same in all a line as cars go pass on either sidenknocked half a star off just for the annoyance and one star for the daytime impressionnnin saying all that i would still highly recommend going but in the evening instead take some food and drinks chill on the grass and enjoy the view
1760,original it was my second time here one of the largest tourist monuments in the world its beautiful its imposing its exciting one of the most amazing places ive visited my last time here the tower was closed because of the snow however and after a lot of patience i managed to get in only the first and second floors were available still its a spectacular view the sunset is beautiful here ü´∂
1764,original tres magnifiqueOK handnbut we didnt plan ahead though so couldnt buy tickets to summit frowning faceÔ∏è plenty of sights to see just walking about though thumbs up
1765,original we got off at the dupleix stop and walked up from the back less people around and we were able to take in a less cluttered view and enjoy a picnic lunch on the benches then we walked around to front where there were many tourists we did not climb the top disappointed that the lawns were all surrounded by wire fence
1766,original this place is very good it a place to relax but it have a lot of people at all time because its the tourist site
1768,original must see in paris we walked to the floor which is roughly of the tower there is a lift option you walk on open stairs but its caged so you cant fall out it feels safe from floor we took a lift to the top there is no stairs option beautiful views there is a toilet at the top also waiting time to get down is a bit long
1769,original it was incredible you need good lungs to walk up but the views and the experience are worth it
1770,original very crowded elevators but omg its beautifulni was here in before all of the security gates too bad
1772,original great to see this icon unfortunately was very foggy so could not see too far we did take some photos the night before thankfully was an easy trip to the second viewing floor toilets were closed on ground floor but had working toilets on floor
1773,original lines to go up the elevator way too long to bother but the park is lovely

1778,original eiffel tower a childhood dream fulfillednnparis france has always held a special place in my heart and visiting the eiffel tower was a dream come true from the moment i first laid eyes on it i was completely awestruck it was more magnificent than i ever imagined exceeding all expectations standing there gazing up at its intricate iron latticework i felt like a child again filled with wonder and excitement it truly felt like stepping into a fairytale a fantasy brought to lifenvisited october
1781,original technically amazing practically nightmarish do not even think about not booking tickets even then we spent more time in lines than enjoying the tower and the viewabsolute chaos try to find the day and hour with the minimum amount of tourists spent in the tower when its actually a experiencenloved it and hated it at the same time
1782,original time here lovely views it can be confusing if you prepurchased tickets ahead of time on what line to get in to go to the top
1783,original very beautiful but so cold and windy we visited with a private tour guide
1785,original a fabulous paris icon that has to be seen sadly so much of the area was fenced off as they were doing renovations you cant get under the tower without a ticketnfor me the best view of the tower was from across the seine at the trocadero
1787,original it is gigantic and pretty in the dark i like it because it has a way to be standing on it and looking outside with out staying inside also it lights for a few hours in the dark so colourful i think it is a phone game but the only thing is that it is gigantic as high as meters it was built and was going to be destructed in the but its usefulness as a radio it saved itself
1790,original not much to say other than its really amazing i preferred it when you could just walk up to it from any direction and stand under it but i was surprised to see that entrance into the footprint and gardens was free and so were the toilets we went after dark which made it stand out even more i think we were probably just lucky that the line to get in was very short so we basically just walked in although you do have to go through security
1792,original the eiffel tower was very good it was a bit pricey around but it was well worth it the view from the top at night it was beautiful and you can see the entire city everybody recommends to go see it every time and i agree because it is one of the best monuments ive seen myself out of
1794,original we arrived late at night and the eiffel tower was lit up in gold and sparkling it was a beautiful site we arrive late so we could not take a trip upstairs but we walked around the area and took plenty of pictures it was amazing amazing
1796,original such a delight to visit this iron wrought structure there are ticket booths available at the entrance wear good shoes because there could be wait time we visited after the olympic days so could have been more crowd than usual but worth the visit also be careful of vendors around
1798,original so many reviews so nothing to addndont save your money for anything else do it climb it enjoy the view and if can a meal at the jules vernesnthe place is an absolute must
1799,original if you just want to get a picture inside the grounds it is free and easy you just have to go through security we are a meal under the tower which was cool
1800,original beautiful place easy access from the trams and buses
1801,original we visited the eiffel tower on new years day at i was not successful to buy tickets online in advanced so we had to go buy at the ticket booth day of the crowds were not that bad and we stood in line for about minutes to buy tickets we were only able to buy floor tickets at the time but were told that we could get back in line hour later to get summit tickets but the floor views were spectacular and well worth the wait
1802,original went to the very top at night and it was magical definitely worth going all the way up even though its windy
1804,original for me the one of major place which needs to be visited during the time in paris smiling face with smiling eyesnthere were a lot of guys who offered various sizes of eiffel towers and after some time it was quite annoying also the ticket price and fence around the tower was not nice but we know why it is there so i respect itnthe tower itself is really big and nice the people working in this area were nice and respectful even there were a lot of people
1805,original easy to take pictures from multiple places we went in the middle of the day and at nighttime its a truly magical site to see highly recommend the visitnnif you want to go into the tower you should buy tickets in advance we went a few days before christmas while you can get in without buying tickets in advance its easier buying in advance so you dont have to waitnnalso the tower lights up at the start of every hour at night and stays lite for minutes
1807,original great experience beautiful views theres a bistro on second floor pizza drinks beers wine
1809,original i mean a must visit place to go tower was beautiful full of tourists around and people trying to sell you stuff but honestly i thought the tower would be much higher than actually it is its not that tall but its beautiful we took the train from the airport to the eiffel tower and it was crazy expensive one way was euros so all around trip would be just to be able to visit the eiffel tower we just took some pictures in front of the tower we didnt go inside since you have to pay to go inside like to euros its not cheap but you can take the elevator and go up the tower
1810,original i was here years ago and experienced something completely different it was not partioned off like it is today anyone could stand under the eiffel tower and walk around in the lovely garden underneath now you need a ticket to go into that area which is useless if you are not going to go up the towernndue to this with all the ugly fences around now it just feels like one big tourist trap and has lost the charm and appeal it once had really sadnnmy daughter went to the top which she said was amazing but im scared of heights and preferred to wait at the bottomnni also saldly got to experience the many clipboard scammers hanging around at the bottom and was so harressed it was not a peaceful experience at all i wont go backnnconsidering the sheer volume of people and the money paris racks in on this one attraction more care should be given to the tourists who make this possible and who pay for their experience more police presence or security and surely more can to be done like a discounted ticket for those who dont want to go up but want to enter the area and to make the area pretty and pleasant it looks like a hot mess
1811,original i mean it is the eiffel tower so its kinda of a must to go always worth it in my opinion recently we went when it was already dark and after rain which allowed us to get through the queue in min and go straight to the top the weather made it less crowded and because of that much more enjoyable i also do recommend to take the stairs on the way down its not as tiring and boring as you may think it actually is more enjoyable than just taking a cramped elevator with ten other people however do take it on the way to the top
1813,original amazing experience just be aware if you book a tour the summit isnt always open thumbs up
1814,original very tall not made of gold no one was selling ice cream but thats fine i love that paris is in the same cinematic universe as ratatouille
1815,original its as beautiful as they say you need to view in the daytime and nighttime separately to fell the difference definitely worth the night view with all the lights the lights starts in the evening and lights up with all dazzles every min after pm please stay to see this and enjoy with your loved ones
1817,original very nice pity it was closed when we visited
1819,original iconic moment its a must visit fantastic views of the city
1820,original a worldclass icon i visited may and it was still bright at so the first sparkling light show was at breathtaking
1821,original beautiful giant in real life sadly a lot of fences around the area which ruins a bit of the experience
1823,original it is like a giant electricity pylon offering a great view of paris plus the opportunity to climb a lot of steps to shed off the effects of all the wine and french cuisine that may have started clinging to the waist line if this is not a concern you can just make use of the lifts and enjoy the views with a glass of champagne in one of the restaurants or from the very expensive bar at the top the eiffel tower is definitely worth visiting one of many iconic symbols of paris
1826,original beautiful weather not too busy worth the visit its a must if youre visiting paris
1827,original iconic huge worth to seennthere is a little park with a great view of the building great to relax
1828,original the eiffel tower is an iconic paris landmark offering breathtaking views of the city from its three levels its stunning design and vibrant atmosphere make it a mustvisit while lines can be long the evening illuminations add a magical charm creating unforgettable memories
1829,original super awesome in summer times plan you visit around evening so si can get good view form top and then see the sparkles around and came even catch a boat rode in between
1830,original seeing eiffel tower for the first time was an amazing feeling building this massive tower was a revolution
1831,original great place to visit while in paris we got tickets to the summit and this made entry quite painless the queues were longnnits pretty ok organized but it gets quite busy we took a slot that allowed us to watch the sunset after checking out the two levels important to note is you can only visit the summit once so good to decide when you want to use thisnthey have food and gift shops the food shops serve pizza sandwiches hot dogs and pastries there is a restaurant that needs to be booked in advancenwe booked our tickets online and this was quite straightforwardnoverall really fun experience for all of usnnps very few toilets that i spotted and at one point they closed it for well over an hour to clean it problem is descending from the top means elevator queues etc bear this in mind if visiting with small kids
1832,original it was one of many visits to eiffel tower in december we climbed up and observed the city under the glumy skynsuddenly the sun broke through the clouds and coloured sein into golden it was amazing
1833,original great landmark if youre going on the tower the best time slot to choose will before and after sunsetnalso if youre planning to stay for the lighting after sunset make sure youre either at the bottom of the floor the lighting experience from the summit isnt worth it
1834,original so glad we bought tickets to the summitnamazing views definitely a highlight
1835,original we used an organised tour for our visit to the eiffel tower we had a skip the line ticket but it wasnt too busy at the timenhaving a guide was helpful as he explained all about the history of the tower which is very interestingnduring our visit the top of the tower was closed for maintenance but the views from the floor are still spectacularnwe used the lift to gain access as theres a lot of stairs so bear that in mindnwell worth a visit
1836,original overall the experience is good however its almost impossible to buy tickets online to go the very top by the elevator all kinds of travel agencies purchase them in bulk to sell them afterwards for the times bigger price if you couldnt book these tickets online but still want to go by the elevator youll have to stand in a huge line on the site
1837,original effiel tower is worth the hype every hour after dark it twinkles and lights up the block we had tickets for pm and the line was minimal the extra money for the lift was worth it gorgeous views from the top the summit is gusty more than expected it was a clear beautiful night on the ground and early winter at the top
1838,original try to visit in the evening hours and you can catch the sunset atop the tower and enjoy the light show when its dark at the top of the hour many little white lights will dance around the tower we were just heading down after seeing the sunset and the main lights turned on and we just missed the sparkle show as we climbed into the elevator this information wasnt shared or we would have been on the lookout so im sharing here catch it if you can
1839,original great a wonderful experience went up the stairs which was a good challenge then i saw the lights after the sunset
1840,original it is definitely one of the most beautiful places in the world you can call this structure a pile of iron but i cannot evaluate it as a pile of iron there is a culture and history there it has a magical atmosphere it should definitely be seen at night i dont think it makes much sense to go to the top floor it is more beautiful to watch the eiffel than to watch the view from the eiffel
1841,original worth a visit amazing structure beautiful vibesnone must have time to visit this place
1842,original it is beautiful to see the structure very family and touristfriendly environment
1843,original the eiffel tower is an absolute mustsee offering one of the most breathtaking views in the world from the top youre treated to a stunning panorama of paris with iconic landmarks like the louvre sacr√©c≈ìur and the seine river stretching out before you whether bathed in daylight or sparkling under the city lights at night the view is nothing short of spectacular the journey to the top is smooth and the staffs warmth and professionalism make the experience even more special one of the highlights is the glass floor on the first level‚Äîits an exhilarating and unique way to view the city from above visiting on a weekday makes the experience even better as fewer crowds allow you to take in the beauty without rushing a truly unforgettable experience that i highly recommend
1844,original we visited multiple times we did not go inside but enjoyed seeing it also stayed one night for the twinkling lights which was cute and very busy watch out for the vendors who try to force things on you and ask for money or take pictures to try and rope you in just say no and walk away
1845,original tickets should be bought in advance then theres nearly no waiting a massive amount of people there but it is the eiffel tower so yes worth the many stairs
1846,original well its the eifel tower its pretty but i wouldnt recommend going up its expensive and at least when i went up some years ago i waited for hours to go up and for an other hour to go down
1849,original worth the visit to see this spectacular structure we did not go up to viewing platforms
1850,original line up to go up the tower is crazy but the eiffel tower is a must visit at least once in your life
1852,original just viewed from outside and it is huge great to see in person
1854,original an amazing experience being in paris and sighting the eiffel tower from various parts of paris even more so when standing directly below it the picnic areas were closed due to grass rehabilitation
1855,original iconic effiel tower best to go champ de mars have a little picnic for the perfect view
1857,original a bucket list item completed humbled but the engineering knowledge from so many years agotruly amazing
1858,original idk how this can get under stars breathtaking from every angle i dont find it worth going up better views are from adt
1859,original the icon of france if you have not visited the eiffel tower you have not visited paris surrounded by historical places it is the symbol of france people all over the world recognize france paris by eiffel towers picturennmade of wrought iron the tower is named after engineer gustave eiffel whose company built the tower a structure of m was completed in tower has three levels with restaurants at first and second level it is more beautiful in the evening when the lights are onnna must visit for every tourist
1861,original eiffel tower never disappoints its an essential part of any trip to paris
1862,original not overrated monthsahead advanced tickets to the summit are highly advised saw too many tourists turned away and disappointed took a guided tour with henry from bonbon tours via viator that explained a lot the summit has limited capacity so one has to wait for the green light to reach the summit even with skiptheline guided tours the views are well worth it
1863,original absolutely fantastic place to visit paris is a city of culture and arts if visiting dont stay near the main attractions as it takes away the real experience of paris there are so many hidden gems just walking about away from the main sights
1864,original crowded as it should be in june a wonderful view and beautiful monument
1865,original paris is synonymous with fashion in the minds of many and while i dont recall ever hearing the eiffel tower described within that context i think that she rightly belongs within that conversationnni doubt that you could ever be cheated by the time of day when glancing at her but i much preferred the opportunity to gaze upon her countenance at night her dazzling lights are draped upon her like a flattering evening gown and she elevates her visage even further at the top of each hour it is then that she sparkles to reflect the light around her like the sequins on her dress ü§©nnterrific views of the tower are available from any location in its vicinity and even if you travel only to its ground level the trek will be well worth your time you should also know that you can access the base of the tower for free and without tickets once you have cleared securitynnif youd like to elevate your experience by ascending the tower acquiring tickets in advance is highly recommended no matter the level you choose to experience the degree views are just as spectacular as youd imagine there is a spotlight that circles the neighboring skyline and i couldnt help but be reminded of the batman signal batnnwhile the elevator system will address your needs of ascension it is helpful if youre able to utilize a few of the staircasesnnif walking here seems a bit out of range the reseau express regional rer trains have a convenient stop very near the base of the towernnthe security protocols here are serious so be sure to budget extra time to clear themnnand thatshenrys takenneiffeltower
1866,original icon of paris must see note in march much of the area is under construction likely better to visit in the spring or summer
1869,original the eiffel tower is incredibly impressive a stunning and iconic landmark in parisnnim looking forward to visiting at night to capture the beautiful light show and impressive memorynnhighly recommended
1870,original marvelous construction and beautiful vibes but visit in the night time when lightning is on is must the ambience is different and justifies why it is one of the wonders of world must visit for sure
1871,original beautiful as always amazing views and architecture its astonishing to look at it bad organization for the access to the floors
1872,original wherever we were in paris you could see parts of the eiffel tower above the buildings it is a beautiful monument to see up close a must see during the day but even better at night
1873,original with all the funding they get from tickets they are unable to solve the problem is queues be prepared for queuing of you want to go to the floor no matter the day its very very bad with crowd management and i would expect such top class destination to handle it far better
1875,original i recently visited paris during my vacation and one of the highlights was undoubtedly the eiffel tower the experience was absolutely fantastic‚Äîseeing the iconic structure up close was truly unforgettable the atmosphere around the tower was lively and full of charm just as i had imaginednnhowever i would advise future travelers to be cautious especially around crowded tourist areas as pickpocketing can be an issue despite this my overall experience was incredibly positive paris has a unique charm and the eiffel tower was a magical part of my trip im so happy i got to see it in person
1876,original book online and take the stairs i was told to go allnthe way to the top or north bother good advice seems you can get to the ground floor for free but need to queue the slot gave me day and night views better than expected and in a poor visibility day
1877,original great experience overall it started cold and then rained towards the end the ticket price is a bit steep but its definitely worth it for the view a clear day is a bonus for taking pictures
1878,original great visit at the end of march crowded wait about an hour without reservations there was no issue getting tickets to the summit top
1879,original this is a once in a lifetime experience and i enjoyed every minute of it
1882,original breathe taking views if your fit take the stairs its only stairs to the first floor
1883,original what is there to say but bring a lunch some wine find a seat and enjoy the view
1884,original very romantic and good to see with the kids
1887,original an absolutely hugh and tremendous structure bought a weekday ticket to the top which is highly recommended otherwise extremely busy over the weekends beautiful views very well organised timed entrance play around with various ticket agents to get a good price highly recommended OK hand
1888,original we visited on the fascinating structure we ordered tickets online before we went because we wanted to guarantee getting to the top this proved a good move because when we visited they werent allowing day tickets to the summit we went back in the evening to see the sparkling lights beautiful
1890,original eiffel tower is the iconic symbol of the city dream destination for me and loved it when we looked for tickets they were all sold out but were able to secure them through a tour company that books in advance on a large scale even though the tickets are expensive its worth it absolutely beautiful to get a great picture you might need to explore the surrounding streets to find the best spot a lot of streets were closed for the summer olympics in paris
1891,original took a tour up the eiffel tower our tour guide was funny and quirky thanks masha ü´∂light skin tone after making it up steps up to the second floor i quickly realized how lucky it was that we only booked tickets to the second floor and not to the top considering how foggy that morning turned out to be still got some amazing views in youd still get to appreciate the view in the midst of the fog sparkles
1892,original we didnt go in or up just walked around the perimeter we got some good pictures and really enjoyed walking around at night the twinkling lights just add to its beauty it seemed to be every minutes they went off and lasted for about minutes what a magnificent structurefinally being able to see it in person is simply a dream come true ü•∞
1893,original a mustsee for anyone visiting france this historic monument the pride and heart of france is located in the capital of france paris you can climb to the top of this tower by taking the stairs and the elevator after purchasing the appropriate tickets
1894,original at on a saturday it just started to sparkled it was really nice to see what more can i say go visit the meter high tower of iron it is really worth it plenty of places to sit
1895,original its smaller than it seems to benbut of course the tower is beautiful
1897,original very busy but spectacularnlooked at all vantage points and always amazing
1898,original loved it the queues were very slow but well worth the time being up that high and the experience
1899,original visited the eifell tower and it was simply stunning be sure to stay for the nightly lights show
1900,original seeing this has been a dream for a long time its as beautiful as shown on so many tv shows and moviesnndidnt go up it but wanted to get a photonnlots of people around and be aware of folks trying to sell stuff or take your photos
1901,original a mustvisit when in paris better get your tickets online as the queue is very long and you might spend hours waiting even for those with online tickets there is a queue and you need to wait a bit the view from the third floor is incredible
1902,original recommend buying tickets in advance view on top is amazing
1903,original i recommend buying tickets not in advance as often suggested but directly at the ticket office near the tower its quick and safe the ascent is very comfortable and there is a restaurant on the level and caf√©s on the level its a very convenient place for family leisure with children
1904,original i decided to visit the eiffel tower at sunset which is pretty early in winter i arrived and walked along the river so that i could take images up close at night when arrived suddenly i heard an escalation of cheering and i looked up to see the entire eiffel tower sparkling with lights the effect lasted approximately mins
1905,original great experience love the views on the eiffel tower have witnessed many engagements during my visit
1906,original took the elevator to the top and highly recommend the view is astonishing of course the eiffel tower is an integral part of the view of paris but viewing paris from on top the tower is remarkable you get a full glimpse of the amazing distribution of pariss roads and buildings which look so large when youre walking through them but like building blocks from atop the towernntickets are quite expensive though and stack up intensely quick if you are paying for several people if you wish to avoid paying and do not climb the tower do not worry pass security and you can still enter the gated area for free and gaze at the tower from otherwise inaccessible perspectives if you prefer to stay and view from the bridge or the park you will still be met with the impressive stature of the tower and some beautiful anglesnnbe mindful of the street vendors which can be intense and insistent ‚Äî just respond repeatedly if necessary with the universal no and youll be fine thoughnnthe towers iconic and touristic status exists for a reason and visiting paris without witnessing one of the worlds most recognized and iconic architectural marvels would warrant that you visit paris again soon and try again
1907,original always a great experience this time with the kids and weather was great
1908,original this is a must when on paris it is truly an outstanding piece of architecture just from below looks unbelievable and getting to the level is breathtaking we could not get to the top because it was too windy and they had it closed for security reason we paid about euros to get to the levelnnthe view there is outstanding be sure to wear a good coat if it is cold at the ground level it will be colder and windy up there be ready to wait in line for long for the elevator and it will be packed to the max with people or if you are brave enough you can take the stairs either way i took them on the way down from the level and my legs were shaking at the end but well be worth itnngoing at night is the best but the lines will be crazy we went around and it was half empty and the city views were awesome too on our way down around pm we could see the lines going around the tower for people to go up either go early and stay up there until night or expect to be in line for hours there are places to eat and sit on both levels
1909,original so magnificent im glad i was able to see this
1910,original you came in paris just for it so i recommend you to go in top of the tower unique its a mustnnthere are different type of tickets with different pricesni choose the one to go walk up to the floor then i took the lift to the top its fun about minutes walk up to the floor you can rest and buy coffee there then another minutes to walk up the floor i recommend this one then wen you come down you take directly the lift from the top to the ground flornnfor the people who cant walk or dont want to walk at all you can take directly the lift from the ground floor up to the top ofc the ticket will be a bit more expensivennyou can buy the tickets onlinennps visiting the eiffel tower park is free you just have to pass the security point you only need tickets if you want to go up the eiffel tower
1911,original such a cool monument its worth the time just walking around it
1913,original very beautiful place better if you have someone special to come here with
1914,original beautiful with adorable historycultural with strong structure
1915,original one of the most renowned tourist landmark
1916,original no description needed for this place romantic stunning amazing fantasticnthe views from the second floor and summit are simply amazing loved this experience
1918,original just as good as i hoped it would be although i recommend booking tickets in advance if you want to use the elevatorgo to the top
1920,original one of the man made wonders if you come to paris this is a must visit you will really like it you can even climb the tower yourself and have a snack at the top if you come in the evening every hour the tower sparkles for five minutes
1922,original amazing tourist attraction beware of pickpockets tho
1924,original lovely tower and the view from the top is just wonderful so breezy and pleasant
1927,original mustvisit in paris the tower is breathtaking both during the day and at night when it sparkles every hour the view from the top is incredible but the long queues can be a bit bothersome
1928,original a must see if you visit paris to go up is a bit expensive but once in life time it is ok to tell you the truth the best view is from the garden just in front of the tower especially during sun down
1931,original it was even bigger than i imagined it was a dream for me to see it sparkling heart i love paris
1932,original yes got the sunset tickets to the top and it was amazing we decided to get a photo at night with the people taking them outside and that did not disappoint a little expensive but worth it
1933,original the most important thing to do in paris great viewsnas a suggestion you can buy your tickets before to save time another tip is always visit it close to the sunset time in that way you can see paris with daylight the sunset and then paris at nightlight
1935,original quick thorough staff for entrynamazing views from level walking up is not for someone with height issues but definitely worth trying
1937,original it is a once in a lifetime experience for my wife and daughters we had such a great time it has the typical touristy vibe and there was a lot of people but it is worth it i thank god for allowing me to give my family this experience
1938,original booked the eiffel tower summit tour by lift direct via the eiffel tower website im not entirely sure of their procedure re releasing tickets for sale however they do not go on sale too far in advance i checked the website daily for a number of weeks before being able to secure tickets third party agents have their tickets months in advance however at an extortionately inflated pricennour booking was for in february therefore at the time of our entry it was dark the tower was lit absolutely stunning the queue through security was efficient as was the queue to enter the liftsnnthe experience was phenomenal views are breathtaking the only reason i opted for stars rather than was due to the overcrowding it was really very uncomfortable made moving difficult especially with childrennnwhilst not related to the eiffel tower itself it is worth noting we traveled to the tower by train trains in total as we had to change at charles de gaulle got off at champ de mars for the tower we had the most horrendous experience with ratp where under duress we were forced with tactics of aggression intimidation to pay ‚Ç¨ fine by ratp en route back to our accommodation horrible end to the evening resulted in our total price of transportation to the tower back coming in at ¬£ pounds sterling id definitely pay a reputable taxi next time
1939,original the most recognised building in paris a must see but it is of course a tourist trapnpricing is high and the street sellers with crappy replicas are a bit of an issue
1942,original very beautiful didnt go up but did walk the base very much let down by the street vendors trying to sell their wares suggest approach from pont de lalma and down rue de monttessuy to avoid main tourist grouping on approach view from place de varsovie also amazing if youre not fussed about getting too close especially on the hourly sparkle
1943,original its world famous for a reason beautiful memorable and historic best view points are bit far from the tower
